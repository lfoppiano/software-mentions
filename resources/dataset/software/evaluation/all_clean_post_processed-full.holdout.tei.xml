        <p>The growth of MDA-MB-231 derived tibial lesions was assessed by longitudinal bioluminescence imaging. The mice were imaged using IVIS spectrum following an intra-peritoneal injection of D-luciferin solution (PerkinElmer, USA) (150 mg/kg body weight) under gas anesthetic. Bioluminescence images were taken 20 min after D-luciferin injection and acquired until the peak signal was reached. Photon emission was quantified using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="a32ca4af9a-software-simple-0">Living Image</rs> software and graphed according to the average radiance (photons/s/cm 2 /sr).</p>
        <p>Histological analysis of tumor burden was performed on hematoxylin and eosin (H &amp; E) stained sections of tibias. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="a32ca4af9a-software-1">Imagescope</rs> software (<rs corresp="#a32ca4af9a-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Aperio</rs>) was used to quantify tumor area in mm 2. Tumor burden was expressed as the proportion of tumor occupying the total area. Tissue fixation and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining were carried out as previously described. <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref> The proliferative index in the bone metastatic lesions was assessed by staining with a Ki67 antibody (1 &#956;g/ml; Abcam, Toronto, ON, Canada). Anti-Cleaved-Caspase 3 staining (0.2 &#956;g/ml dilution; Cell Signaling, Whitby, ON, Canada) was performed to quantify apoptosis within the bone lesions. Following incubation with the primary antibody, secondary biotin-conjugated antibody (Jackson Laboratories) was applied for 30 min. After washing with distilled water, slides were developed with diaminobenzidine (Dako) as the chromogen. All slides were counterstained using Harris haematoxylin before being scanned using a Scanscope XT digital slide scanner (Aperio). Quantification was performed by analyzing bone metastases with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="a32ca4af9a-software-2">Imagescope</rs> software (<rs corresp="#a32ca4af9a-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Aperio</rs>) using positive pixel count algorithm for Ki67 and Cleaved Caspase-3 staining. For quantification of Ki67 and Cleaved Caspase-3 staining, positively stained nuclei were represented as a percentage of total nuclei per field. the difference in &#956;-CT markers, tumor burden and immunohistochemistry staining. Repeated measures two-way ANOVA with interactions was used to calculate the difference in bioluminescence data between the two groups. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

Depending on the goals of the course and the experience of the instructor, the filtering and taxonomic assignments can be done with the students. Alternatively, these steps can be performed by the instructor outside of the class and the taxonomic classification and relative abundance data can be used in class. Many of the academic and commercial sequencing facilities will perform filtering and basic analysis of the raw sequence data. Classes that do not have a wet lab component can analyze data collected by students in other courses or data collected by other investigators.</p>

(2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">CDRT and Cavaliere et al. (2016)</ref> to the case of larger dimensional VARs. Moreover, in order to fully exploit the potential of the conditional analysis we specify a 'full' (and rather arbitrary) structure for the covariance matrix such that the resultant matrix in equation <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> is non-zero for all DGPs considered. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The initial conditions X &#8722;1 and X 0 are fixed to zero. Data are generated by setting a = &#8722;0.4 and = 0.5.

Indeed, any process X t satisfying equation (1) under the I(1,r 0 ) conditions with r 0 = 1 and = (1, 0,&#8230;, 0) can be suitably linearly transformed into the new process X * t such that * X * t &#8764; I (0) with * := (1, 0,&#8230;, 0) . The likelihood ratio test is invariant to such rotation. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The matrix has been obtained using the following spectral decomposition: = GDG , where the diagonal elements of D are generated randomly from a truncated standard normal and the elements of G are generated randomly using the standard normal distribution and such that GG = I p . The specific matrix used in our simulations is available upon request to the authors. We also considered Monte Carlo experiments based on specifications of leading to = 0 in equation <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>.

In particular, to evaluate the impact of the dimension of the conditioning variable vector Z t on the ability of the information criteria to determine the true co-integration rank, we consider the partition X t = (Y t , Z t ), where the dimension of Y t ranges from two to four, i.e. p Y = 2, 3 and 4, which implies a dimension for Z t of p Z = 5, 4 and 3, respectively. Thus, it is seen that the scalar parameter c in the matrix in equation <ref type="formula">(7)</ref> determines whether Z t is weakly exogenous (c = 0) or not (c = 0) for .</p>

        <p>For the bioinformatics analyses, we used a standardised pipeline including (i) quality filtering, (ii) clustering and (iii) taxonomy annotation. Low-quality tails were removed from the reads and trimmed reads with an average Phred quality score less than 25 were discarded. Additionally, we removed all reads with at least one base with a quality of less than 15 and also all reads that contained errors in the primer regions. Multiplex Identifiers were used to separate the different samples. Chimeras were removed using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dc7572678c-software-0">UCHIME</rs> (<rs corresp="#dc7572678c-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">USEARCH</rs> v.<rs corresp="#dc7572678c-software-0" resp="#annotator0" type="version">6</rs>) <ref type="bibr">(Edgar et al., 2011)</ref>.

        <p>Almost half of the IGs and more than half of the genes significantly change their expression level in the Crp(&#192;) mutant relative to the wild-type during the transition from aerobic to anaerobic growth To identify IGs and genes with significant changes in gene expression the statistical analysis of the data was implemented as a two class unpaired experiment, with one class referring to the Crp(&#192;) mutant and the other to the wild-type strain of MR1. Biological replicates and time points were combined because of the high pair-wise correlation between them (87-99%) across genes and IGs within either the wild-type or Crp(&#192;) mutant expression profiles (Supplementary Data 1). Stanford <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator12" type="software" xml:id="ec62815cfc-software-simple-0">Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM)</rs> software (53) was used for the analysis with the recommended parameters and a threshold for false discovery rate of 0.06%. Results of the analysis (Supplementary Data 2) revealed that almost half of the IGs and more than half of the genes significantly changed, either decreased or increased, the level of their expression in the Crp(&#192;) mutant relative to the wild-type. The percentage of IGs yielding significantly decreased expression was about the same (28%) as the percentage of genes that were repressed (31%). About 15% of IGs and 21% of genes had a significantly increased level of expression. Thus, a change in the growth condition in combination with the knockout of Crp, a regulator of the MR1 response to the change, induced significant transcriptional reprogramming of not only genes, but also of IGs in the MR1 genome.</p>
        <p>The information from ShewCyc helped us to understand why the transcription of HexR occurs together with the downstream IG harboring the inhibitor binding site. However, it did not explain the observed downregulation of the inhibitor in the Crp(&#192;) mutant. Additional information on regulation of the genes and an overlay of the regulatory information with the gene expressions in the study can be obtained querying ShewRegDB and using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="ec62815cfc-software-simple-1">Gbrowser</rs> of the database to visualize the results (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</p>

        <p>All nurses and doctors were invited to participate via information sessions followed by a direct approach. Rosters (schedules) from each ward were used to calculate the full-time equivalents for each nurse classification (RN new graduate, RN 2-4 years, RN 5+ years, and CNS) and medical classification (intern, resident, and registrar). The sampling strategy was prepared in order to ensure all hours of the work day and weekdays were sampled proportionately to ensure the sample was representative. Representative sampling was used to determine the number of minutes that participants needed to be observed for each hour of the day for each classification. Following signed consent, nurses and doctors were assigned a study identification number, and demographic information regarding their age, classification, and length of experience was collected. We did not store staff names once a unique identifier was assigned and did not match data for individual staff in the pre-and post-periods. Nurses were given no prior warning of observation periods.Observers randomly allocated nurses to a list for each observation session according to the sampling strategy. If a nurse at the top of the list was not working that day, observers selected the next nurse on the list. A similar approach was used for doctors, but on occasion pre-arranged times were requested as doctors were more mobile and locating them in the hospital could be difficult without this step. Nurses were observed between the hours of 7:00 and 19:00 and doctors from 8:00 to 20:00 on weekdays. Nurses and doctors were observed while both on and off the ward. The <rs cert="0.5" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="e7da55478a-software-simple-0">Work Observation Method by Activity Timing (WOMBAT)</rs> method was applied. <ref type="bibr">30-33</ref> This is a technique for undertaking direct observational studies of health professionals. Using software on a handheld computer, observers capture multi-dimensional aspects of work and communication patterns. The <rs cert="0.5" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="e7da55478a-software-simple-1">WOMBAT</rs> tool automatically captures all time data related to tasks and also details interruptions to work and multi-tasking (ie, tasks conducted in parallel). For example, details of tasks conducted in parallel, such as documenting and answering a question from a colleague, could be recorded and time-stamped automatically. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> provides a screenshot of the data collection tool. The tool can be reconfigured for different task types and study designs. Research teams interested in using this software should contact the corresponding author ( JIW).</p>
        <p>Information sources (eg, desk PC, COW) used in medication tasks were determined by calculating the proportions of total medication task time undertaken using each source. Time spent in interactions was examined in terms of both proportion of total observation time in professional communication, and the proportion of overall task time completed with others.

        <p>The unwinding assay was basically carried out according to the literatures for RNA helicases <ref type="bibr">(36,37)</ref>. 5 0 -32 P-labeled transcript 8 and non-labeled transcript 9 were annealed to prepare the duplex substrate for RlmKL. In this experiment, one guanosine residue was added to 5 0 -end of transcript 8 for efficient in vitro transcription. Annealing was performed in 8 ml aliquot containing 200 mM NH <ref type="bibr">4</ref> OAc, 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 3 mM MgCl 2 , 6 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 2 pmol transcript 8, 2 pmol transcript 9 and 5 0 -32 P-labeled transcript 8 (220 000 cpm) as a tracer. The mixture was heated at 90 C for 1 min and stood at room temperature for 20 min. After 3 min pre-incubation at 30 C, 0.8 ml of the mixture was mixed with 19.2 ml solution containing 200 mM NH 4 OAc, 70 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 3 mM MgCl 2 , 60 mM KCl, 6 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 0.6 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) 1 mM Ado-Met, 4 pmol non-labeled transcript 8 and 10 mg of RlmKL (100 pmol) or acetylated bovine serum albumin (BSA) (B2518 Sigma-Aldrich). The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 C. At each period of time, 5 ml aliquot was taken and mixed with 1.67 ml of 4 &#194; quench solution containing 120 mM ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid, 2.4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 40% glycerol and bromphenol blue (BPB) and left on ice. The quenched mixtures were analyzed by 15% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (29:1) at 4 C. The gel was exposed to the imaging plate to visualize and quantify the duplex and the unwound single strand by FLA7000 imaging analyzer system (Fujifilm). The plot was fitted to one phase decay equation [dsRNA unwound] = [dsRNA] 0 &#193;(1&#192;exp(&#192;k&#193;time/[dsRNA] 0 )) and the half-life was calculated, using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="ad8a4b6e9b-software-0">GraphPad PRISM</rs> <rs corresp="#ad8a4b6e9b-software-0" resp="#annotator7" type="version">5</rs> (<rs corresp="#ad8a4b6e9b-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Graph Pad software</rs>).</p>

The initial crystal structure of PCSK9 from the Protein Data Bank was constructed in the presence of the EGF-A domain of the LDLR at neutral pH. After removal of the EGF-A domain, the PCSK9 structure was remodeled by removal of water molecules and supplementation of hydrogen atoms. The docking scores of chemicals from the ChemBridge Express collection (~450,000 chemicals) were calculated using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator9" type="software" xml:id="bea720089d-software-2">GOLD</rs> software version <rs corresp="#bea720089d-software-2" resp="#annotator9" type="version">4.0.1</rs>. <ref type="bibr">18</ref> A maximum of ten docked poses were calculated for each chemical, with a searching efficiency of 200%.

        <p>Statistical Analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) were used as a measure of the association between the TNF-a 308G.A polymorphism and RHD risk. We evaluated the risk of the AA or GA genotype on RHD compared with the GG genotypes, and then calculated the ORs of GA/AA versus GG and AA versus GG/GA, using dominant and recessive genetic models of the A allele, respectively. Pooled estimates of the OR were obtained by calculating a weighted average of OR from eligible study. The betweenstudy heterogeneity I 2 was assessed with the Q-test <ref type="bibr">31</ref>. Heterogeneity was considered significant if the P , 0.05 among studies. The pooled OR was calculated using the fixed-effects model. Otherwise, the random-effects model was used.

        <p>What remains now is to estimate the within-submarket spatial weight v 0 . Since dwellings within a submarket are in general located closer to each other than those across different submarkets, it is expected that v 0 will be large compared to the cross-submarket spatial weights. We propose maximum likelihood to conduct this estimation. Specifically, for any candidate value of v 0 , we construct the corresponding row-standardized spatial weights matrix W, estimate the spatial error model using maximum likelihood, and evaluate the value of the maximized likelihood. In this way, we construct spatial weights matrices using various candidate values for v 0 , estimate the corresponding spatial error models by maximum likelihood using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a70423884d-software-4">Geoda</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Anselin, 2005)</ref>, and maximize the likelihood over all such candidate values. Standard errors are estimated by numerical approximation to compute the Fisher information at this maximized value for v 0 . 14 Finally, as discussed earlier, we use the <ref type="bibr">Born &amp; Breitung (2011)</ref> regression test to examine the validity of spatial error dependence against a hybrid model including a spatial lag.</p>
        <p>Next, we used the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a70423884d-software-5">GEODA</rs> software <ref type="bibr">(Anselin, 2005; Anselin et al., 2006)</ref> to perform a series of Lagrange Multipliers (LM) tests <ref type="bibr">(Anselin, 2005)</ref> for both spatial lag dependence and spatial error dependence. Specifically, in addition to OLS, we estimated by maximum likelihood (ML) alternative spatial regression models and investigated whether a spatial error or a spatial lag model, or indeed a model <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Moran scatter plot for residuals (contiguity weight matrix). Source: Results were produced using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a70423884d-software-6">GEODA</rs> software <ref type="bibr">(Anselin, 2005)</ref>. without spatial effects, best fit the data. We report the results for a spatial weights matrix based on rook and queen contiguity in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>; results for other specifications of spatial weights are similar. Like Moran's I statistics, we find no evidence of spatial dependence. This is despite the fact that we have not accounted for spatial heterogeneity in these estimates*a feature that can contribute to spatial dependence. The Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test statistics are significant neither for the spatial error (p-value 0.41) nor the spatial lag (p-value 0.77) models. The null hypothesis of both tests, which is the lack of spatial dependence, cannot be rejected at the 5% significance level.</p>

The simulation of the Helical Wheel Projection of the MITS1 N-terminal was from http://rzlab.ucr.edu/scripts/ wheel/wheel.cgi (D Armstrong and R Zidovetzki).</p>
        <p>Imaging was performed using an upright Zeiss Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope LSM510 META (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with a 363 water immersion objective. Transformed leaves were analysed 48 h after infection of the lower epidermis. For imaging expression of YFP constructs, GFP constructs or both, the imaging settings as described by <ref type="bibr">Brandizzi et al. (2002)</ref> were used. Appropriate controls were used to exclude the possibility of energy transfer between fluorochromes and cross-talk.

        <p>MITS1 (AGI: At1g52080) is a putative actin-binding protein of 573 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 66 kDa. The N-terminal region of this protein (39 amino acids) contains a hydrophobic stretch of 20 residues (predicted with <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="c6676625dc-software-simple-6">TMHMM</rs> and <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="c6676625dc-software-simple-7">TMPred</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Hofmann and Stoffel, 1993; Krogh et al., 2001)</ref> and flanking regions enriched with positively-charged amino acids <ref type="figure">Fig. 1A)</ref>. Because of the predicted secondary structure of this sequence, various publicly available bio-informatics tools suggest targeting of MITS1 to mitochondria (see Materials and methods). To confirm this prediction experimentally, full-length MITS1 was fused to the N-terminus of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; <ref type="figure">Fig. 1A)</ref>, and the resulting construct was expressed in tobacco leaf epidermal cells for live cell confocal microscopy analyses. For simplicity, this construct was named MITS1. MITS1 appeared in numerous structures of heterogeneous size and shape <ref type="figure">Fig. 1B)</ref>, resembling the previously described appearance of plant mitochondria <ref type="bibr">(Logan and Leaver, 2000)</ref>. Co-localization analyses of MITS1 with b-ATPase:GFP, a known mitochondrial marker <ref type="bibr">(Logan and Leaver, 2000)</ref>, confirmed that MITS1 localizes to mitochondria <ref type="figure">Fig. 1B)</ref>, thus providing experimental support for our prediction. These observations prompted us to carry out a functional dissection of the NH 2 -terminal extension of MITS1 to identify the targeting determinants within this region.</p>
        <p>The pre-sequence amphipathicity influences the targeting of MITS1 At present, the biological function of MITS1 remains unknown, but publicly available databases (NCBI and TAIR)indicate MITS1 as a putative actin-binding protein, with an 'actinin-type actin-binding domain signature 1' that is similar to a region involved in the actin-binding activity of the chloroplastic actin-binding protein, CHUP1 <ref type="bibr">(Oikawa et al., 2003)</ref>. In addition, several different types of protein domain prediction software revealed that MITS1 contains an AAA-ATPase motif (55-360; SMART, <ref type="bibr">Schultz et al., 1998; Letunic et al., 2006)</ref>, and two leucine zipper patterns (279-300 and 324-345; <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="c6676625dc-software-simple-8">ScanProsite</rs>, <ref type="bibr">(Hulo et al., 2008)</ref>. In contrast with CHUP1, MITS1 is localized to mitochondria. Helical Wheel analysis strongly suggests that the presequence of MITS1 attains a secondary structure with a clustered cationic side that is a known property of mitochondria targeting sequences <ref type="bibr">(Duby et al., 2001)</ref>. The N-terminal part of the mitochondrial pre-sequence is believed to fold into an amphiphilic a-helix both in a phospholipid environment and in vivo <ref type="bibr">(Roise et al., 1988; Lemire et al., 1989)</ref>. Consistent with these observations, the MITS1 mutants with a less defined polar cluster on the side of the helical wheel, compared with the 1-39 peptide, showed a reduced ability to target YFP to mitochondria. Although stability of the a-helix is important for maintenance of mitochondrial import <ref type="bibr">(Hammen et al., 1996; Heard and Weiner, 1998)</ref>, in vivo mutagenesis analysis of a plant presequence from the b-subunit of the F 1 -ATPsynthase from Nicotiana plumbaginifolia showed that the N-terminal helical structure of the pre-sequence is necessary but not sufficient for efficient mitochondrial import, and that its hydrophobic residues play an essential role in in vivo mitochondrial targeting <ref type="bibr">(Duby et al., 2001)</ref>. These findings may explain how peptide 12-39, which maintained a similar cluster of cationic amino acids on the side of the helix in comparison to the full-length pre-sequence, showed targeting to the mitochondria and also to other organelles. It is possible that the distribution of the hydrophobic residues of peptide 12-39 may be altered, resulting in a less efficient targeting signal in comparison to the full-length presequence.:YFP was found in the ER (empty arrow) and Golgi apparatus (arrowhead) as confirmed by the ER/Golgi apparatus marker ERD2:GFP (ER, empty arrow; Golgi apparatus, arrowhead). The mutation of tryptophan 416 to alanine did not affect the distribution of MITS1 to mitochondria (arrow). Insets: magnified section of main panels. Scale bars&#188;5 lm.</p>

Peak identifications were achieved using NIST (Natl. Inst. of Standards and Technology) and Wiley 9th edition (John Wiley and Sons, Inc.,) mass spectra database libraries and linear retention index (LRI). The LRI values were calculated using a calibration curve generated by injecting a mixture of alkane (C8-C18) under previously described conditions. The percentage peak areas were calculated by dividing the peak area of each compound by the total area. To fairly compare the relative amount of each compound in different treatments, we normalized the peak areas using trans, trans-2,4-nonadienal as the internal standard (IS). The compounds' amounts were normalized by dividing their peak areas by IS peak area.</p>

The images were acquired using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="c91bab2cfc-software-3">Image-Pro Plus</rs> version <rs corresp="#c91bab2cfc-software-3" resp="#annotator11" type="version">7.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#c91bab2cfc-software-3" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Media Cybernetics</rs>, Bethesda, MD).</p>
        <p>For live-cell imaging of yeast strains carrying a plasmid, cells were grown at 25&#176;C in SC media lacking a specific amino acid to select for the presence of a plasmid. For imaging yeast strains carrying a chs2 phosphomutation, cells were first grown in SC-LEU medium to keep them healthy and then washed twice with rich medium YM-1 without carbon source. Cells were then incubated further for 1-3 h at 25&#176;C before being concentrated by centrifugation and spotted on a slab of YM-1 medium containing 2% agarose for live-cell imaging. For live-cell imaging at 37&#176;C <ref type="figure">(Figure 6</ref>), the wild-type and the dbf2-1 dbf20&#916; strains were grown in liquid YM-1 media containing 2% raffinose at 25&#176;C to the exponential phase and then shifted to 37&#176;C for additional 3 h. A 2.0-ml culture was then transferred to a 3.5-mm dish coated with polylysine (MatTek, Ashland, MA), which was incubated in the 37&#176;C chamber of the microscope for 20 min to let the cells settle down. A 1.5-ml culture was then removed from the dish, which was followed by the addition of a 1.5-ml prewarmed YM-1 medium containing 2% raffinose, 3% galactose, and 1.5% low-melting agarose. Images were acquired at 25 or 37&#176;C on a spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU 10 scan head combined with an Olympus IX 71 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and an Olympus 100&#215; objective (1.4 numerical aperture, Plan S-Apo oil immersion). Acquisition and hardware were controlled by<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator11" type="software" xml:id="c91bab2cfc-software-0">MetaMorph</rs>, version <rs corresp="#c91bab2cfc-software-0" resp="#annotator11" type="version">7.7</rs> (<rs corresp="#c91bab2cfc-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Devices</rs>, Downingtown, PA). A Hamamatsu ImagEM EMCCD camera (model C9100-13, Bridgewater, NJ) was used for capture. Diode lasers for excitation (488 nm for GFP and 561 nm for mCherry/RFP) were housed in a launch constructed by Spectral Applied Research (Richmond Hill, Canada). Images were taken every minute with z-stacks ranging from 11 &#215; 0.3 to 12 &#215; 0.5 &#956;m. A maximum projection was generated with <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="c91bab2cfc-software-1">Meta- Morph</rs>, version <rs corresp="#c91bab2cfc-software-1" resp="#annotator11" type="version">7.7</rs>, or <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator11" type="software" xml:id="c91bab2cfc-software-2">ImageJ</rs> (<rs corresp="#c91bab2cfc-software-2" resp="#curator" type="version">1.45b</rs>; <rs corresp="#c91bab2cfc-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">National Institutes of Health</rs>, Bethesda, MD). For quantification of relative chitin levels in different chs2 phosphomutants <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>), the ratio between Calcofluor signal intensity at the bud neck was divided by Chs2-GFP signal intensity at the bud neck.</p>
        <p>For the experiments involving FRAP, cells were grown to exponential phase in SC-HIS media at 23&#176;C. Cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 10 ml YM-1 medium and grown for at least another 3 h in a 50-ml flask at 25&#176;C in a water-bath shaker. One milliliter of this culture was taken to concentrate the cells by centrifugation. Cells were then spotted on YM-1 medium containing 2% agarose for FRAP and imaging analysis. FRAP was performed using a Micro Point computer-controlled ablation system (Photonic Instruments, St. Charles, IL) consisting of a nitrogen-pumped dye laser (wavelength, 435 nm) controlled by<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator11" type="software" xml:id="c91bab2cfc-software-simple-11">MetaMorph</rs>. In some cases, sequential photobleaching was applied <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>A, S217D). Images were captured and processed using the same microscope, camera, and software as described earlier. Images were taken every 20 s with a z-stack consisting of 12 &#215; 0.4 &#956;m steps.</p>

The change in the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="b295ed8028-software-2">NONMEM</rs> objective functionvalue and goodness-of-fit plots were used to guide the model development. One-and two-compartment disposition models with first-order absorption and first-order elimination were evaluated based on the previous knowledge of the pharmacokinetic properties of the compound from a single-dose study. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> IIV was assessed on all structural model parameters, as was interoccasion variability (the occasion variable was derived based on the visit number: it was assumed that concentrations measured at different study visits represented distinct occasions). The pharmacokinetic parameters (k a , volumes, and clearances) were assumed to be log-normally distributed around the population mean, but the random effects to describe both IIV and interoccasion variability were assumed to be distributed with a mean of zero. The effects of covariates (age, BMI, creatinine clearance, sex, FEV 1 % predicted at baseline, and weight) on the pharmacokinetic model were investigated once an adequate structural and stochastic model had been finalized. Age was categorized into three groups: 6-11, 12-17, and &#8805;18 years. Each covariate was tested individually against the key structural model parameters k a , V d /F, and CL/F in a stepwise fashion (forward inclusion). After each step, the strongest covariate relationship was incorporated into the model, and the others sequentially and individually retested, until no further covariates could be added with statistical significance. The inclusion of a covariate term was considered statistically significant if it produced a difference of 3.84 (P = 0.05, given a single degree of freedom) in the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="b295ed8028-software-simple-6">NONMEM</rs> objective function value during the forward inclusion and if it produced an objective function value difference of 6.64 (P = 0.01, given a single degree of freedom) during the backward elimination. A combination of proportional and additive error models was used. The visual predictive check was used to provide an assessment of the model's ability to describe the data and the model's suitability for simulation. For the covariates identified after the stepwise process, 1,000 simulations were performed to evaluate their effect on the drug exposure at steady state using the following metrics: C max and C trough . The sensitivity of each metric to a given covariate was evaluated by simulation using different percentile values of the covariate distribution in the pharmacokinetic population, while keeping values of the other identified covariates in the model fixed at their median values in the pharmacokinetic population. These simulations were undertaken using the population parameter estimates from the final model and the IIV values of pharmacokinetic parameters, and they yielded the metrics of interest and their 95% predictive intervals. Further details of the modeling methods can be found in the Supplementary appendix.</p>

        <p>Functional annotation for iRC1080 was performed using a consensus of two separate approaches. In the first approach, gene models (http:// augustus.gobics.de/predictions/chlamydomonas/augustus.u5.aa) from the Augustus update 5 (Au5) of C. reinhardtii genome assembly version JGI v4.0 were functionally annotated by assigning enzyme classification (EC) terms using  <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="abff41cd16-software-simple-0">BLASTP</rs> results against UniProt (http:// www.uniprot.org/) and AraCyc (http://www.arabidopsis.org/biocyc/) enzyme protein sequences and their EC annotations as the basis. The second approach followed from mapping of Au5 gene models to annotated JGI v3.1 gene models, for which EC terms and Gene Ontology annotation were assigned using a combination of <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="abff41cd16-software-simple-1">BLASTP</rs>,  <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="abff41cd16-software-simple-2">AutoFACT</rs>, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="abff41cd16-software-simple-3">InterProScan</rs>, and  <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="abff41cd16-software-simple-4">PRIAM</rs>.

        <p>In the rest of this paper we will concentrate on the case that the players base their decisions on a performance criterion that has an infinite-planning horizon. We will present an algorithm and a corresponding <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a647f3a5a5-software-simple-0">MATLAB</rs> numerical toolbox which solves any form of an infinite-planning horizon affine linear quadratic open-loop differential game. The software, called <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a647f3a5a5-software-simple-1">LQDG Toolbox</rs>, is available as a freeware from the authors of this paper. 1 By rewriting a specific application into the standard framework, one can use the toolbox to calculate and verify the existence of both the open-loop non-cooperative Nash equilibrium (equilibria) and cooperative Pareto equilibrium (equilibria) of any infinite-planning horizon affine linear quadratic open-loop differential game. In case there is more than one equilibrium for the non-cooperative case, the toolbox determines all solutions that can be implemented as a state-feedback strategy that is a common assumption in most of the applications. 2 Alternatively, the toolbox can apply a number of choice methods in order to discriminate between multiple equilibria. For instance, one can choose to report only Pareto-undominated solutions or only those that are characterised by the lowest combined loss of all the players. In order to determine the cooperative solution, the user is asked to specify the relative importance of each player in the cooperative game. Moreover, the user can predefine a set of coalition structures for which they would like to calculate the noncooperative Nash solution(s). Conversely, a coalition structure generator is provided that automatically creates a whole space of coalition structures for a given number of players. Furthermore, the toolbox offers plotting facilities as well as other options to analyze the outcome of the game. For instance, it is possible to disaggregate each player's total loss into its contributing elements, which correspond to the quadratic expressions constituting the player's loss function.</p>
        <p>Step A2 in the above algorithm verifies whether the algebraic Riccati equations (20) have a stabilizing solution. Of course one can use here <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="a647f3a5a5-software-simple-2">MATLAB</rs> to verify this. Concerning the numerical stability of Algorithm 5 we notice that various suggestions have been made in the literature to calculate solutions of Riccati equations in a numerically reliable way (see e.g. <ref type="bibr">Laub (1979, 1991)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Paige and van Loan (1981)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">van Dooren (1981)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Mehrmann (1991)</ref> and Abou-Kandil and Bertrand (1986) for a more general survey on various types of Riccati equations). These methods can also be used to improve the numerical stability of Algorithm 5. In particular, if one considers the implementation of large scale models one should consult this literature.</p>
        <p>Next we proceed with an outline of the numerical toolbox. The software verifies the existence of and, provided that a finite number of equilibria exists, calculates the outcome of the N -player extension of the game (1-3). The scheme presenting all the components of the toolbox software is displayed in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. The main file, called<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a647f3a5a5-software-simple-3">LQDGsolver.exe</rs>, solves the LQDG which is to be defined in the input. The input file can be created by the user using an intuitive input interface provided (file <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a647f3a5a5-software-simple-4">TBXinput- GUI.exe</rs>). Alternatively, more proficient users might choose to create the input file directly (in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="a647f3a5a5-software-simple-5">MATLAB</rs> or text formats). <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a647f3a5a5-software-simple-6">LQDGsolver</rs> produces the following output for every coalition structure considered:</p>
        <p>The above output is saved in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="a647f3a5a5-software-simple-7">MATLAB</rs> and text formats in a directory that corresponds to the chosen name of the project. The following output files are created:</p>
        <p>&#8226; PROJECT_NAME_model.txt: text file containing the structural and reduced form of the dynamic system; &#8226; inputPROJECT_NAME.m: binary <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="a647f3a5a5-software-simple-8">MATLAB</rs> file containing (processed) input to the project; &#8226; PROJECT_NAME_validation.txt: text file containing all the information about the various stages of model validation; &#8226; PROJECT_NAME_output.txt: text file containing all the output produced; and &#8226; outputPROJECT_NAME.m: binary <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="a647f3a5a5-software-simple-9">MATLAB</rs> file containing all the project's output.</p>
        <p>The plotting tool is provided that uses the above output to draw the dynamics of every variable in the model for a chosen coalition structure and equilibrium. Less advanced users can use a simple output interface (file <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a647f3a5a5-software-simple-10">TBXoutputGUI.exe</rs>) that allowsboth to edit the toolbox output and to plot the graphs required. Conversely, more advanced users can directly analyse output of all numerical simulations and create graphs.</p>
        <p>Step T1: <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a647f3a5a5-software-simple-11">LQDG Toolbox</rs> Initialisation To define the LQDG problem the user is supposed to provide a number of compulsory components of the model.

        <p>In this paper we considered a dynamic linear affine structural form model that is affected by different players who all like to minimise their own performance criterion that is a quadratic affine function of the variables occurring in the model. The costs are assumed to be discounted over time and the considered planning horizon by the players is assumed to be infinite. Under the assumption that in the minimisation of their performance the players do not cooperate, we presented both necessary and sufficient conditions under which this problem has a unique open-loop Nash equilibrium, a multiple but finite number of equilibria and or an infinite number of equilibria. A computational framework was provided for how one can numerically solve the problem. The algorithm has been implemented in a form of a numerical toolbox available on the internet. Users, starting from the structural model, can calculate for their specific application the equilibrium strategies and involved cost (if they exist). The toolbox also provides the possibility to calculate for different coalition structures whether the corresponding game will have an open-loop Nash solution. For that purpose the user has to define which coalition structures they like to analyze and what the relative importance is of each player within a certain coalition. We demonstrated both theoretically and numerically in a worked example on dynamic duopolistic competition the use of the toolbox.<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a647f3a5a5-software-simple-20">LQDG Toolbox</rs> is implemented in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="a647f3a5a5-software-simple-21">MATLAB</rs>. In particular, it uses some standard functions of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="a647f3a5a5-software-simple-22">MATLAB</rs> to calculate the eigenstructure of a (|N |n) &#215; (|N |n) matrix, where |N | is the number of involved players andn is the state dimension of the model. Since no additional efforts are taken to calculate this eigenstructure in a numerically efficient way, the practical use of the current toolbox is limited to some extent. This is because for either a large number of players and/or a large state dimension, the accuracy and efficiency is restricted by that of the implemented <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a647f3a5a5-software-simple-23">MATLAB</rs> functions. So for large N and/orn the user should look for an own code to implement the algorithm. Another way one might choose to calculate the equilibrium strategies is by using iterative algorithms. In the literature a number of iterative schemes have been suggested (see e.g. <ref type="bibr">Engwerda 2007)</ref>. A disadvantage of these schemes is that on the one hand they do not provide an answer to the question whether the game will have a unique equilibrium. On the other hand these schemes may converge without providing the appropriate equilibrium strategy. If this happens one is stuck with the question how to proceed.</p>
        <p>For the corresponding problem with a finite planning horizon, at least from a theoretical point, it is clear under which conditions there exists a unique equilibrium (see e.g. <ref type="bibr">Engwerda 2005)</ref>. From a computational point it is also clear how one can calculate this equilibrium. Either one can solve the involved set of nonlinear differential two-point boundary-value equations directly using standard <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="a647f3a5a5-software-simple-24">MATLAB</rs> functions. Another possibility is to transform the involved set of Riccati differential equations (in the spirit of <ref type="bibr">Reid (1972)</ref>) to a set of linear differential equations and then solve this set first (see e.g. <ref type="bibr">Tabak 1975; Engwerda 2007)</ref>. Since the calculations require the numerical solution of a set of (nonlinear) differential equations the dimension of the games for which one can still calculate the equilibrium actions (using standard<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a647f3a5a5-software-simple-25">MATLAB</rs> functions) without problems is usually smaller than in the infinite horizon case.</p>
        <p>Finally, we would like to mention that for discrete time systems much work has been done by <ref type="bibr">Neck et al.</ref> in the development of the numerical software <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a647f3a5a5-software-simple-26">OPTGAME</rs> for the calculation of Nash equilibria in (non-)linear systems in case the performances of players are quadratic (see e.g. <ref type="bibr">Neck et al. 2001)</ref>.</p>

Since the baseline patient characteristics showed significant changes in the five registries, we calculated a risk score for the 2010 MANTRA population using a logistic regression model resulting statistically significant at univariate analysis or considered of clinical interest. These variables included gender, age, diabetes, history of heart failure, prior stroke/transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), peripheral vascular disease, prior renal failure, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, Killip class and atrial fibrillation at admission. This score, evaluated on the 2010 MANTRA population, was also used to standardise the death rates for each of the previous surveys.

        <p>The models were built using three different approaches: 1. Tree-based predictive models i. Decision trees (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-0">Cubist</rs>) ii. Random forests (<rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-1">randomForest</rs>) 2. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-2">monmlp</rs>) 3. Symbolic regression (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-3">rgp</rs>).</p>
        <p><rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator23" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-4">Cubist</rs> is a tree-based modeling approach wherein a linear model is fit iteratively, resulting in a set of linear models at each node starting from the root to the last node of the tree. <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator23" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-5">Cubist</rs> is an ensemble-based technique. All variables that are covered by a linear function at a single node are then discarded from the future iterations for that particular tree. This process is recursively continued until all the input variables have been covered by a single or a set of rules in a tree. This is also known as the separate-and-conquer approach. At every step, the response of the model is analyzed and adjusted to be used by the next model, until the final model is achieved. The final prediction is a simple average of the predictions from each tree in the ensemble. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> random forest</p>
        <p>Random forests are well known tree-based models. One model is shaped by numerous trees in the collection. Independent trees are generated based on sample data randomly taken out of the training data set. Errors exhibited by individual trees are collectively representative of the generalization error of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-6">randomForest</rs> model. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> An extensive search for the best architecture was carried out using a 10cv scheme, followed by training of the best-performing architecture on the full data set.</p>
        <p><rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-0">Monmlp</rs> is the implementation of ANN in <rs corresp="#d984c41c4d-software-0" resp="#curator" type="language">R</rs>. ANNs with<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-9">monmlp</rs> are generalized feed-forward ANNs that work in a monotone fashion using the backpropagation (BP) algorithm</p>
        <p>Khalid et al enhanced by the nonlinear minimization algorithm (nlm) for training. Neural networks imitate the structure of the human brain, whereby information is passed on between neurons in the form of synapses. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-10">Monmlp</rs> allows two hidden layers of neurons, with hyperbolic tangent and linear activation as transfer functions. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> In <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-11">monmlp</rs>, signals move forward from the input layer through sigmoid neurons before reaching the linear output layer.</p>
        <p>Moreover, different activation functions, such as hyperbolic tangent sigmoid (TAN-SIG) transfer function, logarithm sigmoid (LOGSIG) transfer function, and pure linear (PURELIN) transfer function, are the potential transfer functions that can be used in each layer. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> The neural network package <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator23" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-12">monmlp</rs> was run extensively to find the bestperforming network architecture with 10cv. The whole data set was used to retrain the model on the best architecture.</p>
        <p>Genetic programming (GP) is a bioinspired algorithm based on evolution principles to solve complex problems. A complex problem is broken down into smaller, simpler problems with random solutions. These solutions are then evolved through the biologically mimicked process of variation and selection until the end condition is reached or a workable solution is generated. Thus, <rs cert="1.0" corresp="#d984c41c4d-software-1" resp="#annotator22" subtype="component" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-13">rgp</rs> is an implementation of GP methods in the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-1">R</rs> environment. <ref type="bibr">29</ref> Package <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-15">rgp</rs> results are simple representations of the problem without being exposed to a priori information. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-16">rgp</rs> offers various options for initialization, variation, and selection procedures inherent in GP. GP implements a tree structure representation to show the mathematical equations. The tree structure is composed of two parts: function set (nodes) and a terminal set (leaves). <ref type="bibr">30</ref> The function set can be chosen through the operators {+, -, *, /, sin, cos, log, abs}, mathematical functions, conditional statements, or even the user-defined operators. In addition, the terminal set includes constants and model variables. <ref type="bibr">31,32</ref> To find the best solution, different runs were conducted by iterating over GP tuning parameters. The most important tuning parameters are maximum size of the chromosome, the number of generations, and population size. <ref type="bibr">30</ref> The size of the chromosome, which governs the maximum length of the equation, was varied from 5 to 100. The population size was set to 1,000, and the number of generations was set to 500 million evolution steps divided into 100 stages.</p>
        <p>These equations can be optimized by different strategies. <ref type="bibr">33,34</ref> For this experiment, equations were created on the whole data set, and then selected ones were optimized using the simulated annealing (SANN) algorithm, followed by a quasiNewton (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno [BFGS]) method. <ref type="bibr">35,36</ref> independent feature selection by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-17">fscaret</rs></p>
        <p>The package <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-18">fscaret</rs> allows semiautomatic feature selection, working as a wrapper for the <rs cert="1.0" corresp="#d984c41c4d-software-2" resp="#curator" subtype="component" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-19">caret</rs> package in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-2">R</rs>. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-21">Fscaret</rs> is specialized for in silico feature selection experiments, whereby approximately 120 different packages are used to fit models. <ref type="bibr">37</ref> Input feature ranking is extracted from trained models by using weighted averages. Sum of squared errors (SSE), mean squared errors (MSEs), and RMSEs are used to evaluate models. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-22">fscaret</rs> has been successfully implemented in recent studies. <ref type="bibr">38,39</ref></p>
        <p>Data from additional tableting experiments was used to test the trained models. Tablets were made with MCC. The external data set was particularly challenging for the models because roll compaction conditions were kept constant in the training data set while being systematically changed in the external data set. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the results of external validation. The models were able to predict porosity with substantial accuracy using unseen input data. The external data set is composed of experiments with two different roll compactor tooling (cheek plates and rim rolls) and two different roll compaction forces <ref type="figure">(4 kN and 8 kN)</ref> for each. The variety of roll compactor settings introduces variance in the external data set unknown to the trained models. Although CI systems are not known for their extrapolation abilities, <ref type="bibr">42</ref> the models presented herein are able to extrapolate successfully in a small range. Regardless of the complexity in the external data set, the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-23">rgp</rs> model represented by <ref type="bibr">Equation 4</ref> makes accurate predictions of the test cases from all different tooling and force conditions <ref type="figure">(Figure 4</ref>). <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows the levels of accuracy of prediction for the external validation data set. Non-roll-compacted powder is predicted with the most accuracy (NRMSE: 7%), followed by prediction of roll compaction using rim rolls at 4 kN (NRMSE: 9%).</p>
        <p>Further RSM analysis based on the GP equation shows that variation in the amount of MCC does not have a profound effect on the porosity of the tablet, while an increase in the die compaction force considerably reduces the porosity of tablets <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>), a behavior that can be attributed to particle rearrangement followed by plastic deformation during the compression stage. <ref type="bibr">44</ref> Feature selection on the external data set to establish the surplus of discarded variables Plausible performance of the trained CI models on a significantly different external data set could be an occurrence of chance. To study this in detail, important features from both the data sets were compared. Feature selection experiments using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-24">fscaret</rs> were run independently on the external data set. Confirmatory models were developed with a variation of input vectors using the tree-based learning method <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator23" type="software" xml:id="d984c41c4d-software-simple-25">Cubist</rs>. The resulting top features of the external data set are in agreement with the features used to train the models. The results confirm that the die compaction force is the most important variable, with roll compaction force, roll compaction tooling,percentage of material in the formulation, and granule fraction range displaying much lower ranking. Models developed without the information of roll compaction force, roll compaction tooling, and granule fraction range predict porosity of tablets accurately <ref type="table">(Table 5</ref>: experiments with two and three inputs). The successful modeling shows that these variables do not contribute to the outcome within this design space. The results strongly suggest redundancies in the original data set, which, once removed, do not affect the prediction of porosity within the factor space. Correlation analysis of the original data set reveals that porosity is highly correlated to die compaction force <ref type="figure">(Figure 7)</ref>.a nrMse and R 2 are presented. all experiments were done in 10cv mode of data representation.

        <p>In this study, twenty-five patients candidate for elective or emergent open bone fixation of the forearm, carpus and/or hand referred to Hazrat Rasul Hospital, Tehran, Iran, were recruited. The operation should be performed in 90 minutes. Exclusion criteria were patients' refusal to undergo the experiment, history of allergy to local anesthetics, presence of severe heart disease, severe hypotension, seizure, drug addiction, psychiatric diseases, use of antidepressants or anxiolytics, multiple trauma or other organs' involvement and underlying disease in which tourniquet application is contraindicated (such as the Raymond's disease and sickle cell disease or trait). The study received ethics committee approval from Iran University of Medical Sciences. All participants were informed about the type and method of anesthesia and pain measurement individually by the anesthesiologist and written informed consent was obtained from them. To overcome some of traditional method's disadvantages, two changes were made as: 1) The IV cannula was inserted into an antecubital vein; 2) an elastic band was firmly wrapped around the proximal forearm distal to the cannulation site. Lidocaine 0.5% (at least 4 mg/kg totally in 50 mL) <ref type="bibr">(1, 3, 4)</ref> was carefully administered via the IV cannula in less than 90 seconds. The forearm was held perpendicular to the elbow, above the local anesthetic injection site, for five minutes. Then it was fastened with the elastic band distal to the cannulation site to keep the anesthetic agent in the proximal arm and prevent its distal spread. Tourniquet pressure and other details were the same as the traditional method. If pain was present at the tourniquet site, the distal tourniquet would be first inflated and the proximal one deflated. At the end of operation, the tourniquet was totally deflated. The pain was measured and recorded based on the standard verbal descriptive scale of 0-5 scores, presented in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> <ref type="bibr">(13)</ref>. Data including pain at surgical site before the operation, five minutes after the block, every five minutes during the operation, before and after tourniquet entire deflation and then every ten minutes until one hour after the tourniquet deflation were recorded. For each patient pain at the tourniquet site was measured at ten minutes intervals separately after inflating the proximal tourniquet, after inflating the distal tourniquet and after deflating the proximal one throughout the operation. Anatomic site of upper extremity bone undergoing the operation was lower forearm and hand, distal radius or ulna, carpus, metacarpus and phalanges. The type of bone surgery consisted of drilling in association with applying pins, plates and screws. The operation length was individually recorded for each patient. Prior to the operation, an 18-gauge intravenous cannula was inserted on the contra lateral limb for fluid administration. Shortly after the cannula insertion, 1 &#181;g/kg fentanyl and 0.015 &#181;g/kg midazolam were administered for all patients. The tourniquet was carefully deflated following bone fixation to obtain surgical site hemostasis. Considering the side effects of local anesthetic toxicity, patients were evaluated during the operation as well as the first hour of operation <ref type="bibr">(1, 4, 9)</ref>. All patients with mild pain (&lt; 1 on the pain score) following tourniquet deflation received an extra dose of fentanyl (1-1.5 &#181;g/kg). The protocol was to induce general anesthesia if intolerable pain was experienced or if the operation took longer than 90 minutes. Throughout the first 24 hours of the operation, the site of operation was checked for thrombophlebitis, Volkmann ischemic paralysis and cellulitis every four hours and every 12 hours during the next 48 hours. Statistical analysis was performed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="e5dbee7212-software-0">SPSS</rs> <rs corresp="#e5dbee7212-software-0" resp="#annotator3" type="version">13</rs> for windows.

        <p>A panel consisting of 25 microsatellite markers was selected for the diversity analysis of Tibetan sheep population. These were chosen from literature related with sheep diversity studies aiming to analyze highly polymorphic markers spread across the genome. These markers also adhere to the guidelines of International Society for Animal Genetics and FAO (http://dad.fao.org/en/refer/library/guidelin/marker.pdf). Detailed information on primers is presented in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Forward primer of each marker was 5&#8242; labeled with fluorescent dye, i.e. FAM, NED, PET and VIC. PCR amplification was performed in a reaction volume of 25 &#956;l on i-cycler. Reaction mixture consisted of 50-100 ng of genomic DNA, 200 &#956;M of each dNTP, 50 pM of each primer and 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. The amplification was carried out using a Touchdown program for all microsatellite loci, which consists of initial denaturation of 95&#176;C for 1 min; 3 cycles of 95&#176;C for 45 s and 60&#176;C for 1 min, 3 cycle of 95&#176;C for 45 s and 57&#176;C for 1 min; 3 cycles of 95&#176;C for 45 s and 54&#176;C for 1 min, 3 cycles of 95&#176;C for 45 s and 51&#176;C for 1 min and 20 cycles of 95&#176;C for 45 s and 48&#176;C for 1 min.

        <p>The locations of radiographic fi ndings were recorded according to the 3 acetabular zones described by Charnley and to the 7 femoral zones described by Gruen. Osteolysis was defi ned as a non-linear lucency of 3 mm or more around the prosthesis <ref type="bibr">(Claus et al. 2003)</ref>. Loosening of an acetabular component was determined from evidence of migration and a radiolucent line <ref type="bibr">(Hodgkinson et al. 1988, Johnston et al. 1990</ref>). An acetabular component was diagnosed as "loose" when it had migrated more than 4 mm in either the horizontal or the vertical direction, or if it had tilted by more than 5&#176;. Cemented acetabular components that had continuous radiolucent lines with any thickness in all 3 zones were categorized as being loose. Uncemented acetabular components that had radiolucent lines wider than 2 mm in all 3 zones were categorized as being loose. Loosening of an uncemented stem was defi ned by whether the stem was considered to be unstable according to the criteria of <ref type="bibr">Engh et al. (1990)</ref>. Loosening of a cemented stem was defi ned by whether we found a continuous radiolucent line around the stem, or stem subsidence of &gt; 5 mm. Bone defects were assessed using Paprosky's classifi cations <ref type="bibr">(Paprosky et al. 1994, Della Valle and Paprosky 2004)</ref>. Bone areas with reduced density in the acetabulum and proximal femur were recorded as "atrophy" <ref type="bibr">(Wangen et al. 2008)</ref>. Thinning of the femoral cortex adjacent to a well-fi xed stem was recorded as "cortical atrophy" <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>). Heterotopic ossifi cation was defi ned using the classifi cation of <ref type="bibr">Brooker et al. (1973)</ref>. In 3 hips, the proximal femur was replaced with a tumor prosthesis, so we evaluated the acetabular component only. In 1 hip, all the implants had been removed, so we assessed bone defects only. Leg-length discrepancy (LLD) was assessed by comparing the heights of greater or lesser trochanters relative to the line connecting the teardrops of the acetabulum. If the deformity was severe or if the proximal femur was replaced with a tumor prosthesis, we did not evaluate the patient's LLD. For analysis radiographs, we used <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="dac2aee1c2-software-1">Mdesk Orthopaedics</rs> software (<rs corresp="#dac2aee1c2-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">RSA Biomedical</rs>, Ume&#229;, Sweden).</p>
        <p>Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to determine the survival after the primary THR and the fi rst revision surgery. We performed time-trend analyses to assess changes in the revision rate between the periods 1987-1995 and 1996-2010.

This means that the docked ligand must form a coordinated interaction with the heme iron ion from the IDO active site. For the docking, the A chain of 2d0t, which was crystallized as a dimer, was used. The original ligand 4-phenyl-imidazole, the two co-crystallized detergent molecules of 2-[ N -cyclohexylamino]ethane sulfonic acid, and water were removed. The binding site of the original ligand was chosen for the docking. The program defines the open space in the binding pocket with so called alpha spheres that represent available atom positions.

        <p>Confocal microscopy analysis. Drosophila S2 cells were plated in 12-well plastic tissue culture plate in 1 ml of Schneider's medium with 10% FBS. FITC-labeled (Invitrogen, USA) microbes were added to each well containing S2 cells at a density of 5 3 10 6 , followed by incubation for 1 hr at 28uC. After washes with PBS, the S2 cells were transferred to Poly-Prep glass slides (Sigma, USA) and fixed. Then the S2 cells were incubated with rhodamine phalloidin (Invitrogen, USA) or DAPI (Sigma, USA) to label actin or nucleus DNA, respectively. Fluorescent images were taken with a Zeiss Laser scanning systems LSM 510 Meta (Carl Zeiss, Germany) and processed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="bda8ed08f7-software-simple-0">Zeiss LSM Image</rs> Examiner Version software.</p>
        <p>Analyses of gene expressions with oligonucleotide microarray. S2 cells (1 3 10 6 ) were inoculated with DCV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 1 hr. Inactivated DCV was treated in the same way. The WSSV virions (1 3 10 7 copies/ mL) or inactivated WSSV virions (1 3 10 7 copies/mL) were inoculated into S2 cells (1 3 10 6 cells/mL) for 1 hr. Then total RNA was extracted from treated S2 cells by using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total RNA samples were then analyzed by CapitalBio Corp for Chip (Affymetrix) assay. Gene expression analysis was performed by using the Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA) Drosophila GeneChip, using the laboratory methods in the Affymetrix GeneChip expression manual. Gene expression analysis was performed using multiple arrays and multiple independent mRNA samples for each treatment. Microarray data were analyzed by using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="bda8ed08f7-software-4">Bio MAS (molecule annotation system)</rs> <rs corresp="#bda8ed08f7-software-4" resp="#annotator10" type="version">3.0</rs> software (<rs corresp="#bda8ed08f7-software-4" resp="#curator" type="publisher">CapitalBio Corporation</rs>, Beijing, China). Using the criterion of cutoff limitation as a fold change $2 or #0.5 and q-value #5%, differential expression genes were screened and clustered.</p>
        <p>Biological pathway analysis. Through array analysis, the commonly altered genes were screened from DCV, and WSSV treatments. The selected genes were further analyzed in the context of Gene Ontology (GO) biological process and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) biological pathway. Then the results of signaling pathway and protein interaction about these genes were analyzed by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="bda8ed08f7-software-0">MAS</rs> <rs corresp="#bda8ed08f7-software-0" resp="#annotator10" type="version">3.0</rs> software.

        <p>Quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNAs were extracted from S2 cells (1 3 10 6 ) using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then the total RNA (5 mg) was reversely transcribed to synthesize cDNA in a volume of 20 mL with reverse transcriptase M-MLV (Takara, Japan). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using gene-specific primers and TaqMan probe <ref type="table">(Table S2)</ref>. Relative expression levels of interest genes were calculated as previously described <ref type="bibr">43</ref>, using rp49 as an internal control in S2 cells. Real-time PCR was carried out in a final volume of 20 ml, which contained 10 ml Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa, Japan), 1 ml diluted cDNA template, 7.2 ml distilled water, 0.3 ml of each TaqMan probe and 0.4 ml of each primer. PCR conditions were as follows, 95uC for 30 seconds, followed by 50 cycles of 95uC for 5 seconds and 60uC for 30 seconds. Resultant data were analyzed using the<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="bda8ed08f7-software-simple-7">iQTM5</rs> software.</p>
        <p>WSSV quantitative analysis by TaqMan real-time PCR. TaqMan real-time PCR was performed by using a Perfect Real Time premix (Takara, Japan) containing a high-performance Taq antibody, Takara Ex Taq HS, for hotstart real-time PCR.<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="bda8ed08f7-software-2">Primer</rs> <rs corresp="#bda8ed08f7-software-2" resp="#annotator10" type="version">3</rs> software was used to design primers and the TaqMan probe with the WSSV whole sequence (GenBank accession no. AF332093). Primers WSSV-RT1 (59-TTGG TTTCATGCCCGAGATT-39) and WSSV-RT2 (59-CCTTGGTCAGCCCCTTGA-39) produced a fragment of 154 bp after amplification. The TaqMan probe was synthesized and labeled with the fluorescent dyes 5-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) (59-FAM-TGCTGCCGTCTCCAA-TAMRA-39). The reaction mixture consisted of DNA aliquot, 200 nM of each primer, 100 nM of each TaqMan probe, and 1 3 PCR reaction buffer containing DNA polymerase in a final reaction volume of 20 ml. PCR amplification was performed for 4 min at 50uC, followed by 45 cycles of 45 s at 95uC, 45 s at 52uC and 45 s at 72uC. Thermal cycling was performed on an iCycle IQ5 realtime PCR detection system (Bio-RAD, USA).</p>

Fisher exact test P value ,0.05 without multiple-testing correction was deemed statistically significant. Cell cultures. Mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes were prepared and cultured as previously described (28) from CD-1 mice (Harlan Laboratories, Inc.). All animal procedures complied with the Guidelines of the Italian National Institutes of Health and with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Academy of Sciences, Bethesda, MD) and were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. Primary human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Clonetics Corp.), and human HEK293T cell line (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured as previously described <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>. For transforming growth factor (TGF)-b stimulations, HUVECs were cultured in 1% FBS endothelial basal medium (Lonza Group Ltd.) for 14 h and then stimulated for 48 h with 0-50 ng/mL TGF-b (R&amp;D Systems). For hypoxia and high glucose stimulations, cells were cultured in the presence of either 25 mmol/L glucose or 5 mmol/L glucose plus 20 mmol/L mannitol (iso-osmotic control) for 72 h. Next, they were incubated in hypoxia (1.0% O 2 ) or normoxia for a further 24 h, as previously described <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>. Statistics. Continuous variables are expressed as mean 6 SE. Gaussian distribution was tested by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For group-wise comparisons, Mann-Whitney test (two groups), ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test (n groups), or t test (two groups) were used as appropriate. For categorical variables, x 2 test was used. Spearman rank correlation was used to compare levels of miRNAs with clinical factors. All tests were performed two-sided and P # 0.05 was considered statistically significant. For statistical analysis and heat map data visualization, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="e043051487-software-1">GraphPad Prism</rs> version <rs corresp="#e043051487-software-1" resp="#annotator4" type="version">4.03</rs> (<rs corresp="#e043051487-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">GraphPad Software Inc</rs>.) and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="e043051487-software-2">Genesis</rs> <rs corresp="#e043051487-software-2" resp="#annotator4" type="version">1.7.2</rs> (<rs corresp="#e043051487-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Graz University of Technology, Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics</rs>) software were used, respectively.</p>
        <p>To determine miRNA scores, the mean fold change of all the miRNAs belonging to each specific analysis (D-HF vs. CTR, ND-HF vs. CTR, and ND-HF vs. D-HF) was calculated for each patient and the minus sign was inverted before calculating the mean. Bioinformatic analysis. Bioinformatic prediction of miRNA target genes was performed using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e043051487-software-simple-9">miRonTop</rs> <ref type="bibr">(26,27)</ref>. Predicted miRNA target genes were compared with differently expressed genes (P # 0.01) displaying an opposite modulation with their corresponding miRNA.

        <p>Next, experimentally validated and predicted targets of each miRNA were analyzed, and mRNA/miRNA couples displaying reciprocal modulation were selected. Statistical analysis allowed the identification of 140, 329, and 11 miRNA/mRNA interactions in the D-HF versus CTR, ND-HF versus CTR, and D-HF versus ND-HF groups, respectively (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). A subset of the identified miRNAtarget modulations was further validated by qRT-PCR in cardiac biopsies (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) and in a cell culture system (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Gene interaction and pathway analysis of global gene expression changes. To facilitate the interpretation of the complex gene expression changes observed in the different experimental groups, we used <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e043051487-software-simple-11">Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA)</rs>, exploring for enriched biological functions and pathways. We applied a low-stringency approach, prioritizing sensitivity to maximize the identification of the potentially involved categories.</p>

        <p>The genome-scale mapping of promoter sites has been performed by our pattern recognition software <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-0">PlatProm</rs> <ref type="bibr">(6,7)</ref>. The same as other protocols operating with position-specific weight matrices, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-1">PlatProm</rs> has an advantage of predicting transcription start points (TSP) (the main promoter attribute, which is determined experimentally), rather than to define promoter regions as extensive genomic loci <ref type="bibr">(9,10,15,16)</ref>. Upon scanning <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-2">PlatProm</rs> considers any nucleotide as a probable point of transcription initiation and scores this probability by searching for promoter-specific elements in proper positions. Rather high precision and low rate of false positives made our software suitable for genome scanning, providing a possibility to compare in silico and in vivo data. In the present work, we describe an overall map of TSPs predicted by<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-3">PlatProm</rs>; evaluate the degree of correlation between<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-4">PlatProm</rs> scores and RNAPol-binding efficiency registered by two independent research groups <ref type="bibr">(12,13)</ref>; focus attention on intragenic TSPs and promoter 'islands' having high density of transcription signals over long distance; and verify capacity of one 'island' to bind RNAPol and initiate RNA synthesis.</p>
        <p>Our scoring system was designed as originally suggested by <ref type="bibr">Hertz and Stormo (17)</ref>. Sensitivity of this algorithm tested on our sets was the same as reported <ref type="figure">(Figure 1B)</ref>. To increase the performance of this approach, we took into account sequence-dependent structural features in the genomic environment of promoter sites <ref type="bibr">(6, 7)</ref>. The final version of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-5">PlatProm</rs> <ref type="bibr">(7)</ref> was refined on 271 experimentally identified non-homologous and non-overlapping s 70 -promoters with a single TSP precisely pointed out by the previous version of our software <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref>. All sequences were 411-bp long (&#192;255/+155 according to the start point nominated as 0). Allowed variations of the spacer, *To whom correspondence should be addressed. Tel: +7 4967 73 91 40; Fax: +7 4967 33 05 09; Email: ozoline@icb.psn.ru and the distance between the TSP and the element -10 were 14-21 and 2-9 bp, respectively. Variable length of the spacer was accounted by the matrix penalizing deviations from the optimal 17 bp in accordance with their frequencies in the training promoter set. The varying distance between element &#192;10 and the TSP, ignored by previously published protocols, was taken into account the same way. Weight matrices corresponding to consensus elements &#192;35 and &#192;10 evaluated hexanucleotides, rather than 25 and 19 bp sequences, accounted by Hertz and Stormo <ref type="figure">Figure 1A and B)</ref>. They contain 6 &#194; 4 scores equal to natural logarithms of normalized occurrence frequencies for each nucleotide at each position in preliminarily aligned promoters. Percentage of particular nucleotides in the genome was used for normalization. Sequence preference nearby the TSP previously accounted by a 12 &#194; 4 weight matrix <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref> was scored by the matrix precisely reflecting the distribution of dinucleotides in &#192;1/0. Dinucleotides forming the 'extended &#192;10 element' were accounted the same way. Since frequency coefficients depend on promoter alignment, optimal matrices were generated by the procedure of expectation-maximization.</p>
        <p><rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-6">PlatProm</rs> also takes into account perfect direct and inverted repeats (5-11 bp long separated by 5 or 6 bp) as potential targets for interaction with regulatory proteins. They are scored as natural logarithms of lengths if centered in subregions of their frequent occurrence <ref type="figure">(Figure 1B)</ref>.</p>
        <p>Performance of the program was tested on a set of 290 known promoters and two control sets (CSs). All sequences were 411 bp long (&#192;255/+155 according to real or virtual TSPs). The testing compilation was composed of experimentally characterized s 70 promoters not included in the training set. To increase the size of this set we allowed the presence of promoters ($30%) with multiple TSPs (for instance discussed below dcuA), while homologous or overlapping promoters were excluded. CS1 was composed of 273 coding sequences taken from the fixed position of all convergent genes longer than 700 bp, separated by 50-bp intergenic space, which are not associated with promoter 'islands' (see below) and have 5 0 -ends similarly annotated in U00096 and U00096.2 E. coli gene maps. Sequences were taken so as virtual TSPs were 250 bp far from initiating codon (fall in position 254 inside the gene). This strategy minimizes the probability to pick out functional promoter for alternative transcription or for yet unidentified genes in intergenic regions. Having AT-content (48.3%) very close to that of the whole genome (49.2%) CS1 roughly represents natural sequences, which RNAPol has to bypass. CS2 was composed of 400 random sequences with the same AT-content as in chromosomal DNA. (All compilations are available by request.) Promoters were considered as recognized by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-7">PlatProm</rs> if experimentally mapped TSP(s) or a neighboring nucleotide (AE2) had score higher than threshold level. Using this criteria and the last version of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-8">PlatProm</rs> we identified 85.5% of promoters from the test compilation at zero level of false positives (level 1, <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) in both CSs (S max = 3.4). Thus, at this level the combination of sensitivity (percentage of recognized promoters = 85.5%) and specificity (percentage of unrecognized non-promoter sequences = 100%) of<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-9">PlatProm</rs> was better than that of previously suggested algorithms (68.7-82% and 82.2-99.1%, respectively) <ref type="bibr">(2,15,24)</ref> andpredicted by our software, which is also better than previously reported (&lt;50%) <ref type="bibr">(1,17)</ref>.</p>
        <p>Primer extension was carried out using RevertAid TM M-MulV reverse transcriptase (Fermentas), 4 pm of 32 P-labeled primer and variable amounts of total RNA (1-6 mkg) purified from E. coli cells grown either in LB or M9 media and harvested at logarithmic or stationary phases. Before the reaction the mixture of RNA and primer was heated at 728C for 10 min; cooled down to 588C, and primer annealing was allowed for 3 min. Then the probe was chilled on ice, mixed with the buffer provided by manufacturer and incubated with the enzyme at 428C for 45 min. Reverse transcription was terminated by heating. cDNA was precipitated by N-butanol and analyzed the same way as the products of permanganate footprinting. Single round transcription was carried out as described previously <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> demonstrates advantage given by each additional element <ref type="figure">(Figure 1B)</ref> and increased sensitivity of the program <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>C and D) for the whole testing compilation and positively regulated promoters. All additional elements improve the resolution but the largest contribution is given by w-tracts increasing sensitivity for 27.6% <ref type="figure">(Figure 1B)</ref>. This high significance of additional elements provides a chance to detect regulatory regions in newly sequenced genomes if information about their own promoters is insufficient. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> exemplifies promoters accurately recognized (fadB) and unrecognized (dcuA) by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-10">PlatProm</rs>. The start point of fadB-transcription exactly fits the experimentally mapped TSP <ref type="figure">(Figure 2B)</ref>, while the original program <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref> suggests intragenic P1 as a dominant transcription signal <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>A) and algorithm developed by Huerta and Collado-Vides (1) predicts fadB promoter $150 bp upstream of the real TSP [see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> in <ref type="formula">(1)</ref>].</p>
        <p>Although it can not be excluded that P dcuA has some important determinants, which are not formalized by<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-11">PlatProm</rs>, limitations of experimental mapping performed by primer extension (28) also may result in some difference between apparent and actual TSPs. Reverse transcriptase, for example, can stop at sites with stable hairpins in mRNA structure. In this case, the registered site of transcription initiation would be pointed out downstream from the real one. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-12">PlatProm</rs> predicts a good candidate (P2) perfectly fitting the RNAPol-binding site registered by ChIP-on-chip assay (Figure 2F). Thus, comparing in silico and in vivo data one should take into account finite sensitivity and selectivity of computer model as well as limited accuracy of experimental approaches. Even though <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-13">PlatProm</rs> may be further improved on the basis of additional features, current version predicts TSPs with rather high accuracy and was used to depict the genome-wide distribution of potentially transcribed regions.</p>
        <p>The genome sequence of E. coli K12 (NCBI, GenBank entry U00096.2) was used for large-scale promoter prediction (see <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 1</ref> for all <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-14">PlatProm</rs> scores on both strands). Only signals with S &gt;7.44 (level 2 in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>D) were considered reliable. This cut-off level provides a possibility to identify only 51.0% of known promoters (Figure 1D) but ensures p &lt; 0.000043 (Student's T-test statistics) if average S (&#192;5.0) and SD (3.1) were estimated using scores of CS1. Artificially generated sequences of CS2 showed the same variability of S (SD = 3.1) but average score was higher (&#192;4.2), thus assuming $2.5-fold higher p-value (p &lt; 0.00011). A total of 30 188 individual or clustered TSPs <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>) forming $5000 promoter-like regions were found. Since only half of known promoters have TSPs with S &gt;7.44, the data obtained presume existence of more than 9000 of separate promoter-like sites, which is twice greater than the number of annotated genes in the genome of E. coli. To what extent this excess could be explained by the presence of false positives?</p>
        <p>Relying on p-values only 399-928 of 30 188 predicted TSPs (1-3%) may be false signals (4 639 675 bp &#194; 2 &#194; p). However, intragenic and artificial sequences of CS1 and CS2 may be deficient in some promoter-specific features. That is why <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-15">PlatProm</rs> performance was further tested in intergenic regions separating convergent genes, even though each of them may contain yet unidentified genes. Predicted TSPs were searched in the central part of intergenic space (!250 bp from the ends of flanking genes) so as to ensure that only non-coding sequences undergo scoring. Only 15 regions between convergent genes are longer than 500 bp but two of them overlap with promoter 'islands' (see below) and were eliminated. The total length of the remaining ones is 10 226 bp (both strands).As expected, AT-content of these regions is slightly higher (49.2%) than that of CS1 (48.3%). Altogether they contain four predicted TSPs (one per $2500 bp). If all of them are spurious, the probability to come across a false positive is 0.00039, i.e. higher than p-values mentioned above. However, two predicted TSPs are perfectly suitable for small regulatory RNAs HB_48 and HB_139 predicted by Carter et al. <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref> and one is located in front of IS yi21_6. Supposing that they belong to real promoters, false positive rate given by statistic analysis and scanning procedure correspond to each other. Even if p = 0.00039 is taken as a real frequency of false signals, still $90% of TSPs predicted by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-16">PlatProm</rs> should be considered as promoter-like signals deserving more detailed analysis.</p>
        <p>An important question is how to perceive <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-17">PlatProm</rs> signals forming clusters near real and accurately recognized by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-18">PlatProm</rs> TSPs (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>B for example). Should they be considered as false positives or not? To address this question we compared distribution of scores in positions surrounding real (test compilation) and virtual (CS1) transcription starts <ref type="figure">(Figure 1E-G</ref>). An average S quantified for CS1 remains almost constant if the size of analyzed area increases. The number of signals exceeding 'level 1' in AE 2 and AE 5 bp area (11 and 24, respectively) corresponds to the expected values (11 and 26, respectively) if CS2 statistic is used but is twice larger than expected from p-value (&lt;0.0038) calculated on the basis of CS1 scores (6 and 12). The rate of false positives given by CS2 statistic is, therefore, quite realistic. It assumes 0.63 probability for the presence of highly scoring position in the AE 10 area around virtual TSPs of CS1 (total number of positions is 5733). One signal with S &gt;7.44 ('level 2') was really registered in this region <ref type="figure">(Figure 1G)</ref>.</p>
        <p>Portion of positions with S exceeding 'level 2' and the average S decrease upon widening of the analyzed area around real promoters, however, distribution of their scores does not reveal expected maxima typical for CS1 <ref type="figure">(Figure 1E and F)</ref>. Only in AE10 region S-values shownoticeable divergence. That means that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-19">PlatProm</rs> scores around real TSPs are higher than background values. Thus, the total number of positions with S &gt;3.4 for AE2 bp area (1681 points) is significantly larger (852) than the total number of experimentally mapped starts including multiple ones (480). Detailed examination showed that $92% of additional signals are generated by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-20">PlatProm</rs> using the same frame for &#192;35 and &#192;10 hexanucleotides as position with maximal S. Remaining ones correspond to alternative &#192;10 element (4.4%) or &#192;10 and &#192;35 elements (3.6%), suggesting the presence of overlapping promoter. Promoters with multiple TSPs tend to have additional signals corresponding to alternative pair of core elements. Thus, in all cases <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-21">PlatProm</rs> signals proximal to known TSPs denote the presence of either the same or alternative promoter and should not be considered as false positives.</p>
        <p>Approximately 19% of the remaining TSPs were found on the opposite strand of coding sequences <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>). Antisense RNAs, if initiated therein, may block translation by base pairing with mRNAs, regulate their stability or interfere in other molecular processes. Such RNAs control expression of many plasmid and transposon genes, but until now they were not considered typical for bacterial regulatory networks. Nonetheless several lines of evidence support our predictions:Thus, the first amusing outcome obtained from the genome scanning was a large amount of genes containing promoters with antisense orientation. Unexpected intragenic promoters of another group have sense orientation <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>). About 23% of corresponding TSPs lie &lt;50 bp downstream from the initiating codon. They were not considered as candidates for independent transcription initiation, since corresponding promoter-like regions may participate in polymerase trapping near real promoters (1). Some intragenic promoters may intensify transcription of properly oriented downstream genes. If they are also ignored, there are still $400 potential TSPs with a less comprehensible destination. Some of them may produce RNAs antisense to mRNAs of the convergently oriented downstream genes. Synthesis of shortened mRNAs seems to be the most exotic assumption to date. At the same time, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-33">ORF Finder</rs> (<rs corresp="#bb9998316e-software-33" resp="#curator" type="publisher">NCBI</rs>) reveals alternative ORFs supplied with a suitable Shine-Dalgarno sequence downstream of $50% of intragenic co-directed promoters.</p>
        <p>At the last step we estimated the degree of correlation between the values of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-24">PlatProm</rs> scores, and efficiencies of RNAPol binding. Since S reflects probability of any single nucleotide in the genome to be a TSP, while ChIP-on-chip method estimates efficiency of RNAPol binding to a particular genomic region represented by 50 nt probes on high-density tiled microarrays, the pattern of S should be converted into a comparable mode. Converting procedure should take into account that the geometrical center of RNAPol-binding site does not coincide with the TSP. Moreover, as RNAPol in vivo interacts with double-stranded DNA, samples prepared for chiphybridization contained both strands of enzyme-trapped fragments. Thus, fluorescent signal registered for a particular probe may result from two types of complexes differing in enzyme orientation <ref type="figure">(Figure 4A)</ref>. Supposing each 50 nt probe as a target for interaction with polymerase we thus considered the sum of S corresponding to the virtual TSPs on both strands as a probability of enzyme binding (P):</p>
        <p>As the spacer length and the distance between the TSP and &#192;10 element differ in real promoters, AE8 nt variation in +1 positioning has been allowed. Location of these regions relative to 5 0 -ends was selected experimentally as position giving maximal correlation coefficient (R) between P and hybridization signals.Are these R H and R R values high or not? Although the data obtained in silico and in vivo reflect the same phenomena: anticipated and registered interaction with RNAPol, there are some peculiarities decreasing evaluated correlation. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-25">PlatProm</rs>, for instance, accounts putative modules for interaction with regulatory proteins as positive elements, though repressors decrease polymerase binding. Many weak RNAPol-binding sites are not detected in vivo due to low signal-to-noise ratio <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref> but<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-26">PlatProm</rs> discriminates them. Intensity of ChIP signals from some promoters may disproportionately decrease due to possibility of epitope occlusion by other interactions <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref>. Finally, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-27">PlatProm</rs> is currently attuned to s 70 -specific promoters, while s 70 -specific antibodies precipitate s 28 as well <ref type="bibr">(13)</ref>. Usage of b 0 -specific antibodies in combination with rifampicin-chase selection allows promoters of all types to be extracted. Considering all these realities, we conclude that both values of R are rather high.</p>
        <p>To explore further this phenomenon a set of 181 known promoters accurately recognized in silico and possessing no more than two additional <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-28">PlatProm</rs> signal(s) on either strand in a AE50 bp area was compiled (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). Amid others it contains promoters P fadB , P cusC , and P cusR <ref type="figure">(Figures 2 and 4)</ref>. Only 21 promoters from this set contribute to the population of 2106 outlying probes by 42 representatives, which is exactly as much as expected by chance ($2%). The set of 'normal' promoters was compared with 78 PIs in terms of RNAPol binding and transcription efficiency calculated as described in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> legend <ref type="table">(Supplementary Tables 2 and 3</ref>Since blue outliers in the second data set tend to fit better to the expected range of log 2 ratios, this slight deviation was not considered as regular and was not further analyzed. Points representing promoter 'islands' 1-3 <ref type="figure">(Figure 4B)</ref> are shown in green. The indicated values of R were quantified for the whole set of microarray probes using (log 2 ) B and P averaged within running window 3. (C) Correlation between RNAPol binding (log 2 ) B and expression (log 2 ) E efficiencies plotted for 78 PIs (red symbols) and 181 single promoters (blue symbols). For PIs (log 2 ) B were quantified as average values of ChIP-on-chip signals for all probes covering corresponding genomic areas <ref type="table">(Supplementary Table 2</ref>). (Log 2 ) E was first quantified as an average log 2 ratio of chip signals obtained upon cDNA hybridization with 10 probes representing the 250-bp region downstream from the last predicted TSP on each strand. Two values characterizing transcription in both directions were then compared and the largest one was considered as the measure of expression efficiency. Other variants of (log 2 ) E calculation see in <ref type="table">Supplementary Table 2</ref>. (Log 2 ) B and (log 2 ) E for 'normal' promoters were quantified within 250 bp region upstream and downstream from the position +1, respectively (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>). Both (log 2 ) B and (log 2 ) E were averaged for two replicates of Reppas et al. <ref type="bibr">(13)</ref> data set. First-order regression lines show apparent dependence between (log 2 ) B and (log 2 ) E for both promoter 'islands' and 'normal' promoters. competing promoters, which makes genomic regions differing in abundance of transcription signals dissimilar in terms of functional characteristics.</p>
        <p>Comprehensive annotation of newly sequenced genomes implying mapping of genes along with their regulatory elements is currently becoming a long-term strategy appealing for effective promoter-finders. In the case of genes encoding proteins, rRNAs and tRNAs, which by itself are accurately identified by almost perfectly attuned computer programs, promoter-finders may assist in localization of regulatory regions. In the case of genes encoding small untranslated RNAs they are used to point out positions where sRNAs may be initiated <ref type="bibr">(29,39)</ref>, whereas other programs classify potential products as putative sRNAs based on their thermodynamic features and folding propensity. In the case of aRNAs promoter-finders may provide unique indicators of potential antisense transcription. So far only two dozens of aRNAs at least partly synthesized from the antisense strands of other genes have been found in E. coli. This rather small number apparently does not reflect their multiplicity, as genome-wide expression studies registered a huge amount of RNAs generated from antisense strands <ref type="bibr">(30)</ref>; <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-29">PlatProm</rs> predicted many potential promoters for antisense transcription, while ChIP-on-chip technique detected suitable intragenic RNAPol-binding sites <ref type="bibr">(12,13)</ref>. Even though many signals registered by microarrays may result from run-through transcripts unterminated at 3 0 -ends of neighboring genes, some promoters predicted in silico may be false positives while intragenic RNAPol-binding sites may represent paused elongation complexes, combined data vote for antisense transcription in bacteria.</p>
        <p>Along with potential TSPs for antisense transcription our screen revealed a large number of intragenic promoters with sense orientation and preferred location near the initiating codon. Though expediency of alternative transcription remains vague, very similar phenomenon has been recently registered in eukaryotic genomes [see, e.g. ref. <ref type="bibr">(40)</ref>]. In the chromosome of E. coli, there are several pairs of extensively overlapping genes encoding two proteins or a protein and an untranslated RNA. Many of them may be transcribed from common promoters. However genes hokC, tpr and ygeN with 5 0 -ends mapped within mokC, rttR and ygeO, respectively, as well as 46 transcripts partly matching sense strand and detected in the fraction of short RNAs by Vogel et al. <ref type="bibr">(31)</ref> may be also initiated from their own promoters predicted by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="bb9998316e-software-simple-30">PlatProm</rs>. Internal promoters with sense orientation may, thus, mark candidates for alternative transcription.</p>

Ions having a smaller radius can approach the charge on D65 more closely, as well as giving it access to a larger accessible volume (entropic effects, i.e., excluded volume effect) in the selectivity fi lter. This increases the ion occupancy of the selectivity fi lter for smaller ions, and thus increases the permeability for smaller ions (see further discussion in the online supplemental material).</p>

Since the distribution of continuous variables significantly deviated from normal (Gaussian) distribution, mean values and a measure of dispersion, for their comparison is used the median and interquartile range and nonparametric test (ANOVA), normal and ordinal variables in the study were analyzed by &#967;2 test and in the lack of expected frequencies used Fisher's exact test. The statistical analysis used the Pearson &#967;2 test for difference distribution of nominal and ordinal data. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the frequency of dysplasia (L-Sil and H-SIL) in relation to the normal cytological findings.</p>

        <p>Strain identification by MALDI-TOF MS and 16S rRNA sequencing Among the 18 culture conditions previously selected by culturomics <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>, strain MC1 grew on sheep's blood-enriched Colombia agar (bioM&#233;rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). The colonies were obtained by spreading samples on a solid medium. They were then purified by subculture and identified by MALDI-TOF MS <ref type="bibr">[28,29]</ref>. Colonies were deposited in duplicate on a MTP 96 MALDI-TOF MS target plate (Bruker Daltonics, Leipzig, Germany), which was analysed with a Microflex spectrometer (Bruker). The 12 spectra obtained were matched against the references of the 7567 bacteria contained in the database by standard pattern matching (with default parameter settings), with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="d4dd357178-software-1">MALDI BioTyper</rs> database software <rs corresp="#d4dd357178-software-1" resp="#annotator3" type="version">2.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#d4dd357178-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Bruker</rs>). An identification score over 1.9 with a validated species allows identification at the species level, and a score under 1.7 does not enable any identification. When identification by MALDI-TOF MS failed, the 16S rRNA was sequenced <ref type="bibr">[30]</ref>. Stackebrandt and Ebers <ref type="bibr">[31]</ref> suggest similarity levels of 98.7% with the 16S rRNA sequence as a threshold to define a new species without performing DNA-DNA hybridization.</p>
        <p>ORFans were identified if all the performed BLASTP procedures did not give positive results (E value smaller than 1e-03 for ORFs with sequence size higher than 80 aa or E value smaller than 1e-05 for ORFs with a sequence length smaller than 80 aa). Such parameter thresholds have already been used in previous work to define ORFans. Genomes were automatically retrieved from the 16s RNA tree using <rs corresp="#d4dd357178-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Xegen</rs>'s <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="d4dd357178-software-2">PhyloPattern</rs> software <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref>. For each selected genome, complete genome sequence, proteome andORFeome genome sequence were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information FTP site. All proteomes were analysed with proteinOrtho <ref type="bibr">[38]</ref>. Then for each couple of genomes a similarity score was computed. This score is the mean value of nucleotide similarity between all orthologue couples between the two genomes studied (AGIOS) <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>. The entire proteome was annotated to define the distribution of functional classes of predicted genes according to the clusters of orthologous protein groups (using the same method as for the genome annotation). To evaluate the genomic similarity among the compared strains, we determined two parameters: digital DNA-DNA hybridization, which exhibits a high correlation with DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) <ref type="bibr">[39,40]</ref>, and AGIOS <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>, which was designed to be independent from DDH.</p>
        <p>The genome is 2 793 868 bp long with 63.23% GC content (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). It is composed of 14 scaffolds (composed of 71 contigs). Of the 2575 predicted genes, 2508 were proteincoding genes and 67 were RNAs (four genes are 5S rRNA, three genes are 16S rRNA, three genes are 23S rRNA and 57 genes are tRNA genes). A total of 1804 genes (71.93%) were assigned as putative function (by COGs or by <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d4dd357178-software-simple-5">NR BLAST</rs>). One hundred fifty-one genes were identified as ORFans (6.02%). The remaining 475 genes were annotated as hypothetical proteins (18.94%). The National Center for Biotechnology Information ID is PRJEB14666, and the genome is deposited under accession number FLTI01000001. The distribution of genes into COGs functional categories is presented in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>.</p>

Following the process of decalcification and dehydration, the muscles were embedded in paraffin, cut into 5-&#181;m sections and stained using hematoxylin and eosin. Muscle fibers (&#8805;100 in each group) were observed in bright-field using Nikon ECLIPSE TS100 light microscope (Tokyo, Japan) and Nikon D7200 image acquisition system.

To correct quantitative variations in the intensity of protein spots, spot volumes were normalized as a percentage of the total volume of all the spots present in a gel. Only spots that were consistently present in the gels from at least three rats in each group were analyzed to avoid spot differences that were due to gel-to-gel or biological variation inherent among the rats. The protein molecular weight, which ranged from 10 to 100 kDa, and the isoelectric point (pI), which ranged from 3 to 10, of each protein spot were calculated by the software using the distributions of standard markers and pI positions, respectively.</p>
        <p>Selected protein spots were excised from the gel and cut into ~1 mm 2 pieces. Samples were destained using 50% (vv) acetonitrile (ACN) and 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate (100 &#181;l, pH 8.0) for 15 min, this was repeated three times until the destaining process was complete. The gel samples were dipped into 100% ACN (30 &#181;l, pH 8.0) for 5 min until they turned white. They were dried at room temperature and the samples were then digested using trypsin (8 &#181;l, 0.005 mg/ml) at 37&#730;C for 16 h. The digested proteins (0.3 &#181;l) coupled with 0.3 &#181;l matrix were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis using a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) to obtain the peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) with 4,600 laser intensity.

        <p>FDG-PET scanning was performed to detect orthotopic tumours. The <ref type="bibr">18</ref> F-FDG was produced and provided by Sk&#229;ne University Hospital Cyclotron Unit. For PET-imaging, mice were intravenously injected with approximately 30 MBq of FDG and were imaged 1 h after administration using a preclinical PET/CT-scanner (Bioscan, USA). Mice were anaesthetised using 2-3% isofluorane and were placed in a temperature regulated animal chamber (Minerve, Bioscan, USA) with the temperature set to 37 C (Minerve multistation controller unit) during the scanning. During the acquisitions, respiration was monitored on PC (SA Instruments, Inc, USA) and anaesthesia levels were adjusted accordingly. CT scanning was performed using the X-ray exposure of 600 ms and 177 lA, and the zoom level set to medium zoom. The CT images were scanned with 180 projections/rotation, pitch 1.0 and a binning of 1:4. The CT reconstruction was performed utilizing a Butterworth filter algorithm. The PET acquisition was performed with the coincidence mode set 1-3. The PET data was acquired in list mode for 30 minutes, and reconstructed dynamically using the OSEM option and rebinning SSRB to 2D LOR with the ring difference set to 8. CT and PET images were evaluated and created using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c14654bd29-software-0">InVivoScope</rs> software (<rs corresp="#c14654bd29-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">InviCRO</rs>).</p>
        <p>Mice were anaesthetised using 2-3% isofluorane in 200 ml/ min O 2 / 200 ml/min NO 2 . Animals were restrained to an MR bed via head fixation. Breathing was monitored using a pressure sensitive pillow, temperature was monitored using a rectal probe and heating was regulated during MRI data acquisition to keep body temperature at 37 C (SA instruments, Inc, USA). MRI was performed at a field strength of 9.4 T (Agilent Technologies, USA). Respiration triggered fat suppressed fast spin echo images were acquired using a spin echo preparation (10 ms) and an echo spacing of 10 ms (acceleration factor 4, effective echo time: 27 ms, 4 averages). The repetition time was set between 800 and 950 ms depending on the breathing rate of the animal. The acquisition of the data for the 12 slices was spread over 4 respiration phases to achieve a T1-weighting corresponding to a repetition time of about 3.2-3.5 sec. Coronal and sagittal sections were acquired with an in plane resolution of 1563137 lm and a slice thickness of 1 mm, while the transversal direction was acquired with an in plane resolution of 1373137 lm. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c14654bd29-software-1">ImageJ</rs> <rs corresp="#c14654bd29-software-1" resp="#annotator3" type="version">1.46r</rs> with a plugin provided by Agilent to import their proprietary format FDF images was used to analyse the images.</p>

        <p>Cultured SK-N-BE(2)c cells, fresh tumour explants from SK-N-BE(2)c orthotopic tumours, patient tumours and PDXs were snapfrozen and stored in 280 C freezer for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis. Briefly, DNA was extracted from the cells and tissues using DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the instructions. We used the Affymetrix CytoScan HD platform for SNP array analysis of cultured SK-N-BE(2)c cells, SK-N-BE(2)c tumours, PDXs and patient tumour #3. High resolution microarray analysis was performed by hybridisation of genomic DNA on arrays, using equipment and protocols as recommended by the manufacturer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The Affymetrix CytoScan HD chip contains approximately 2.6 million markers distributed throughout all chromosomes; of these almost 750,000 are SNPs enabling detection of copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity. The practical resolution of the method is 10-50 kb for deletions and 30-150 kb for duplications; depending on the probe density of each segment. HumanCytoSNP-12 DNA Analysis BeadChip (299,140 markers 10 kb average distance) from Illumina (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was used for SNP array analysis of patient tumour #1 and patient tumour #2. DNA amplification, tagging and hybridisation to the chip were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (http:// www.illumina.com).

For exclusion of constitutional copy number polymorphisms, the Database of Genomic Variants (http://projects.tcaq.ca/variation) was used. Genomic position annotations were based on the hg19 build (http:// genome.ucsc.edu/) of the human genome sequence. Copy number variation analyses were performed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="c14654bd29-software-simple-8">Nexus</rs> software.</p>

        <p>In order to test the heterogeneity of pooled HR, Cochran's Q-test and Higgins I 2 statistics were performed. P&#57388;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Random-effects model was used to calculate pooled HR when between-study heterogeneity was revealed (P&#57388;0.05), and fixed-effects model was conducted when between-study heterogeneity did not reach the statistical significance (P&#57390;0.05). Subgroup analysis, sensitive analysis, and meta-regression were used to investigate the sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed by using Begg's test and Egger's test. <ref type="bibr">32</ref>,33 <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="e97382ab7a-software-3">STATA</rs> version <rs corresp="#e97382ab7a-software-3" resp="#annotator26" type="version">12.0</rs> (<rs corresp="#e97382ab7a-software-3" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Stata Corporation</rs>, College Station, TX, USA) was used to perform all the analyses.</p>

        <p>BG2 cells were obtained from Drosophila Genome Resource Center (Cell line stock number, 51), and cultured according to the protocol form the provider (https://dgrc.bio.indiana.edu/ include/file/general_maintenance.pdf). BG2 cells with or without SP treatment were lysed in protein extraction buffer containing 50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.2, 8 M Urea, 75 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM &#946;-glycerophosphate, 1mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate and 1 mM PMSF. After sonication, protein concentrations were determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, UK). Protein samples (100 &#956;g each) were chemically reduced (5 mM, DTT) and alkylated (25 mM, IAA) prior to trypsin digestion. After 4-fold dilution with 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.2), the protein samples were enzymatically digested using a sequencing grade trypsin at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:50 at 37&#176;C for 16 h. Digestion reaction was stopped by the addition of 90% formic acid to a final concentration of 1%. Resulting tryptic digest peptide samples were desalted for subsequent phosphopeptide enrichment procedure. Phosphopeptides enriched with IMAC POROS 20 MC were subsequently subjected to the micro RPLC-MS/MS analysis described previously <ref type="bibr">(Choi et al., 2011)</ref>. Briefly, analyses of phosphopeptide-enriched samples were performed using Agilent 1100 Series high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Agilent Technologies) coupled to a linear quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ, Thermo Finnigan, USA). The resulting MS/MS spectra searched against a composite protein database containing the IPI mouse protein database (v.3.28), and its reversed complement using SEQUEST algorithm (<rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="da24894043-software-simple-0">Sor- cerer system</rs>). Differential modification search options for phosphorylation modification (+80 on Ser, Thr, Tyr), and oxidation (+16 on Met), were considered in the search. 'Peptide prophet' and 'Protein prophet' scores of 90% was used to filter the search results. We applied the log2(protein ratio) from relative spectral counts (Rsc) for label free quantification <ref type="bibr">(Old et al., 2005)</ref>. RSC = log2[(n2 + f)/(n1 + f)] + log2[(t1 -n1 + f)/(t2 -n2 + f)] where, for each protein, RSC is the log2 ratio of abundance between Samples 1 and 2; n1 and n2 are spectral counts for the protein in Samples 1 and 2, respectively; t1 and t2 are total numbers of spectra over all proteins in control and SP-treated samples; and &#402; is a correction factor, set to 0.5 <ref type="bibr">(Beissbarth et al., 2004)</ref>. Ammonium bicarbonate, calcium chloride, dithiothreitol (DTT), iodoacetamide (IAA), sodium chloride, sodium orthovanadate (Na 3 VO 4 ), sodium fluoride (NaF), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), sodium &#946;-glycerophosphate, urea and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH 4 H 2 PO 4 ) were purchased from Sigma (USA). Formic acid (FA) and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were obtained from Merck (Germany). HPLC grade acetonitrile (ACN), methanol and deionized water were all purchased from Fisher Science. Sequencing grade modified trypsin was obtained from Promega (USA). Aqua C18 (particle size 5 &#956;m) reversed-phase column material was purchased from Phenomenx (USA). The IMAC POROS 20 MC was purchased from Applied Biosystems (USA).We also used the published lines UAS&gt;stop&gt;mCD8-GFP <ref type="bibr">(Yu et al., 2010)</ref>; LexAop-FLP <ref type="bibr">(Bussell et al., 2014)</ref> and UAS-mSP <ref type="bibr">(Nakayama et al., 1997)</ref> in this study. To generate CG3542-LexA and CG3542-GAL4, we performed a PCR amplification of the genomic region 5&#8242; of the CG3542 transcriptional start site (+228 to -22) (forward primer, 5&#8242; NNGCGGCCGCCGATAA CAGAAAATCTACCGGGT-3&#8242;; reverse primer, 5&#8242;-NNTCTAGA CCCACGCTAGGAGGAACATT-3&#8242;) and cloned the product into the pENTR vector (Invitrogen). We then recombined this into the pBPnlsLexAp65Uw vector for the LexA line or the pPTGAL4(+) vector for the GAL4 line <ref type="bibr">(Pfeiffer et al., 2010)</ref>. We injected each final plasmid into embryos using standard techiniqes for insertion into a specific site on the second chromosome (VIE-72A) using phiC31-mediated recombination.</p>
        <p>We dissected ovaries in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) and fixed them in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After washing them with PBST, we incubated them with a rabbit anti-GFP antibody (1:1000; Invitrogen, A11122) for 48 h at 4&#176;C. After washing, we then incubated the samples for 24 h at 4&#176;C with an Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:1000; Invitrogen, A11008) secondary antibody and an Alexa 555-conjugated phalloidin (1:1000; Invitrogen, A34055) to visualize actin in the muscle-rich reproductive tract. Finally, we mounted the tissues in Vectashield and imaged them with an LSM 700/Axiovert 200M confocal microscope (Zeiss). All confocal images are maximal intensity Z-projections.

        <p>In a case-control study, cases and controls ideally match on all characteristics except the variable of interest. In order to consider the confounding effects of unmatched characteristics, we treated them as covariates in a multiple logistic regression analysis. Variables with P values less than 0.2 for differences between the two groups were considered to be covariates: these included age, marital status, literacy, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Results were reported as mean&#177;standard deviation for quantitative variables and percentages for categorical variables. The groups were compared using the Student's t-test for continuous variables and the chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test as appropriate) for categorical variables. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for OR were calculated. To decrease the effects of probable confounders, adjusted ORs were estimated when appropriate. Results for which P values were 0.05 or less were considered statistically significant.

        <p>In order to manage phytosanitary risks in an ever growing and increasingly dynamic import and export market, the EU 7th Framework Program funded the Quarantine Barcoding of Life project to develop a quick, reliable and accurate DNA barcodebased diagnostic tool for selected species on the EPPO A1/A2 lists and EU Council Directive 2000/29/EC (www.QBOL.org). There are currently almost 350 pest and quarantine organisms, covering bacteria, phytoplasmas, fungi, parasitic plants, insects and mites, nematodes, virus and virus-like organisms on the EPPO A1 (currently absent from the EPPO region) and A2 (locally present but controlled in the EPPO region) lists of organisms that require standardised protocols against introduction into, and spread within, the EPPO region. Under QBOL, informative loci from the selected quarantine species and their taxonomically related species were subjected to DNA barcoding from voucher specimens in order to produce reliable DNA barcode sequences that are made publicly available through an online and searchable database called <rs cert="0.5" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d48df52443-software-33">Q-bank</rs> (<rs corresp="#d48df52443-software-33" resp="#curator" type="url">www.q-bank. eu</rs>) <ref type="bibr">(Bonants et al. 2010)</ref>. Within the QBOL project, the CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre (Utrecht, The Netherlands), was tasked with barcoding the Mycosphaerella complex (order Capnodiales, class Dothideomycetes) on the EPPO A1/A2 lists and their taxonomically related closest sister species <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>.</p>
        <p>Most of the DNA used during this study were isolated from pure cultures that were either available at, or were made available to, the CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre, Utrecht, the Netherlands (CBS). Reference strains were either maintained in the culture collection of CBS, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan culture collection (MAFF) and/or at the LNPV -Mycologie, Malz&#233;ville, France (LNPV) <ref type="table">Table 1)</ref>. Fresh collections were made from leaves of diverse hosts by placing material in damp chambers for 1-2 d. Single conidial colonies were established from sporulating conidiomata on Petri dishes containing 2 % malt extract agar (MEA) as described earlier by <ref type="bibr">Crous et al. (1991)</ref>. Colonies were sub-cultured onto potato-dextrose agar (PDA), oatmeal agar (OA), MEA <ref type="bibr">(Crous et al. 2009b)</ref>, and pine needle agar (PNA) <ref type="bibr">(Lewis 1998)</ref>, and incubated at 25 &#176;C under continuous near-ultraviolet light to promote sporulation. Morphological descriptions are based on slide preparations mounted in clear lactic acid from colonies sporulating on PNA. Observations were made with a Zeiss V20 Discovery stereo-microscope, and with a Zeiss Axio Imager 2 light microscope using differential interference contrast (DIC) illumination and an AxioCam MRc5 camera and software. Colony characters and pigment production were noted after 1 mo of growth on MEA, PDA and OA <ref type="bibr">(Crous et al. 2009</ref>b) incubated at 25 &#176;C. Colony colours (surface and reverse) were rated according to the colour charts of <ref type="bibr">Rayner (1970)</ref>. Sequences derived in this study were lodged with GenBank, the alignments in <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d48df52443-software-36">TreeBASE</rs> (<rs corresp="#d48df52443-software-36" resp="#annotator5" type="url">www.treebase.org</rs>), and taxonomic novelties in <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d48df52443-software-37">MycoBank</rs> (<rs corresp="#d48df52443-software-37" resp="#annotator5" type="url">www.MycoBank.org</rs>) <ref type="bibr">(Crous et al. 2004a)</ref>.</p>

Bayesian analyses (critical value for the topological convergence diagnostic set to 0.01) were performed on the individual loci using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="d48df52443-software-1">MrBayes</rs> v. <rs corresp="#d48df52443-software-1" resp="#annotator17" type="version">3.2.1</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Huelsenbeck &amp; Ronquist 2001)</ref> as described by <ref type="bibr">Crous et al. (2006b)</ref>. Suitable models were first selected using Models of nucleotide substitution for each gene as determined using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="d48df52443-software-2">MrModeltest</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Nylander 2004)</ref>, and included for each gene partition. The substitution models for each locus are shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. Teratosphaeria nubilosa (CPC 12243) was used as outgroup for all phylogenetic analyses.</p>
        <p>The ITS locus is the prime candidate for the primary locus. ITS has recently been proposed as one of the primary fungal barcoding loci <ref type="bibr">(Schoch et al. 2012)</ref>. ITS sequencing data is easily obtained and a good starting point to rapidly identify genera and sometimes species. If an unknown genus or species is not represented in a curated database such as <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d48df52443-software-simple-14">Q-bank</rs>, a GenBank blast could be used to supplement these curated databases. Mycology has a long history of using ITS data to identify fungal species and GenBank would thus be a good supplementary (although not completely curated) database. The use of ITS as the primary locus, and if necessary using a secondary locus following a molecular decision protocol, would be the most stable approach for a reliable identification. This is also the identification protocol as it is currently implemented in <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="d48df52443-software-simple-15">Q-bank</rs>.</p>

The sample size was based on a previous study <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> which had a three-dermatome difference in maximal block height with an alpha error of 0.05 and a power of 90%. Twenty-two patients per group were necessary to demonstrate statistical significance. To compare variables between the two groups, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to identify the variables with a normal distribution. Variables with a normal distribution were compared by independent t-tests. Spinal anesthesia in second trimester and those without a normal distribution were compared by the Mann-Whitney U-test. The number of patients was compared between the groups using the chi-square test. Value comparisons for each measurement were also conducted using repeated measures of ANOVA. All significant results were also analyzed with Tukey's post hoc test to determine whether time points produced values significantly different from baseline values. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

        <p>For determination of the relative motilities (relative molecular weight [M r ]), marker polypeptides were also electrophoresed with protein samples, in a non contiguous lane to avoid contaminations, and blotted to nitrocellulose, namely: rabbit muscle phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.2 kDa), hen egg-white albumin (45 kDa), bovine carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (21.5 kDa), and hen egg white lysozyme (14.4 kDa) (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA). Densitometer tracings of the unstained polyacrylamide gel at 280 nm were obtained by a Photovolt Densitometer Model 520 A (Photovolt Corporation, New York, NY). The absolute integrated optical density of each band was analyzed by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="beb9cfd1cc-software-0">GelPro analyzer</rs> software (<rs corresp="#beb9cfd1cc-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">MediaCybernetics</rs>, Silver Spring, MD), which allowed to calculate the molecular weight of the unknown bands in the CB samples.</p>
        <p>The membranes were exposed for 3 days to a high-density phosphor imaging screen (Bio-Rad Laboratories), which captures latent images produced by the emissions of the 125 I radioisotope. Upon laser-induced stimulation, light was emitted from the storage phosphor screen in proportion to the amount of radioactivity in the sample. Wide linear dynamic range (5 orders of magnitude) enables quantitation and visualization of both weak and strong signals in a single exposure. After digitalization of the results, the screen was exposed to extra-bright light of ImageEraser light box and reused. A laser scanning densitometer (GS-250 Molecular Imager System; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) was used to convert the radioactive signals emitted by the immunoreactive areas on the phosphor screen into digital images for subsequent densitometric analysis by the software package <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator19" type="software" xml:id="beb9cfd1cc-software-1">Phosphor Analyst</rs> (<rs corresp="#beb9cfd1cc-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Bio-Rad Laboratories</rs>, Hercules, CA) <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>.

        <p>The present study describes a gentle and reproducible technique for forming EC-MSC islets that is designed to take into consideration the inherent characteristics of the various cell types involved and to take advantage of the anchorage-dependent growth of ECs and MSCs. Our data demonstrate that addition of MSCs to our composite islets enhanced the capacity of ECs to enclose the islets without compromising the functionality of the islets. Importantly, the MSCs stimulated EC sprout formation not only into the surrounding matrices, but also into the islets where intraislet capillary-like structures were formed. negative for CD14, CD34, and CD45) and were used from passage 3-9 (FACScalibur; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Potential EC contamination of the MSC population was assessed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson) (n &#1005; 3). The cells were stained for CD90 (1:100; BD Bioscience Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), the EC pan marker CD31 (1:100; Becton Dickinson), and the lectin Ulex europeaus agglutinin-1 (UEA-1, 1:100; Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, U.K.). Human dermal microvascular ECs HDMECs (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) derived from adult dermis were cultured on 1% gelatin-coated flasks in EC Growth Medium Microvascular with supplements (EC medium; PromoCell). The ECs were used from passage 3-12. Cell labeling. MSCs and ECs were labeled using CellTracker (CT) green and CT orange CMRA, respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Thymidine assay and coculture of cells. Thymidine assays were performed according to a standard proliferation protocol measuring [ 3 H]thymidine (1Ci/ml) incorporation <ref type="bibr">(16)</ref>. ECs were plated in 24-well plates, with 25 &#1003; 10 3 cells/well in EC medium with supplements for 24 h and then cultured in EC medium without supplements but containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum (starvation medium) for an additional 24 h (basal control) or stimulated with either VEGF-A (20 ng/ml; Peprotech, London, U.K.) in starvation medium or MSCconditioned medium (supernatant from 24-h MSC cultures in starvation medium). <ref type="bibr">[</ref> 3 H]thymidine incorporation (at 20 -24 h) was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Triplicate samples were assayed in three individual experiments. A mixture of 25 &#1003; 10 3 CT green-labeled MSCs and 25 &#1003; 10 3 CT orange-labeled ECs were cocultured in eight-well glass culture slides (Becton Dickinson) with EC medium and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy after 3 days. Coating of islets of Langerhans with ECs and MSCs. Islets of Langerhans (10,000 -30,000 islet equivalents) were incubated within 2-5 days after isolation with 0.5 &#1003; 10 6 CT orange-labeled ECs (EC islets) or with 0.25 &#1003; 10 6 CT green-labeled MSCs in combination with 0.25 &#1003; 10 6 CT orange-labeled ECs (EC-MSC islets) in a total volume of 500 l. The cell suspensions were incubated at 37&#176;C for 2-3 h in suspension culture tubes in EC medium and mixed gently twice per hour during the incubation. Thereafter, the EC islets, EC-MSC islets, and untreated control islets were cultured for up to 6 days at 37&#176;C in EC medium or islet medium (CMRL; Invitrogen) until analyzed. The medium was changed every second day. Quantification of EC adherence was performed on EC islets and EC-MSC islets after 1 and 4 days of culture. In vitro islet survival assay and cytokine and insulin content determination. A total of 100 islets per donor (n &#1005; 6) were hand picked: 50 islets were coated with 5 &#1003; 10 3 MSCs and 5 &#1003; 10 3 ECs, and 50 islets were untreated. All islets were cultured for 6 days in EC medium, with a medium change every second day. The number of remaining islets in the respective groups were counted after 1, 3, and 6 days of culture, and the islet number was confirmed after 6 days by dithizone staining <ref type="bibr">(18)</ref>. Control and EC-MSC islets were collected after 6 days of culture. Total DNA (Picogreen; Invitrogen), interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6 (R&amp;D Systems, Oxford, U.K.), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) (Serotec, Oxford, U.K.), tissue factor (TF) (Imubind; American Diagnostica, Stamford, CT), and insulin (Mercodia) contents were measured on a Gyrolab workstation (Gyros, Uppsala, Sweden), and the values were divided with total DNA. Four or more different islet isolations with 20 islets in each condition were analyzed. Dynamic perifusion. The functionality of the islets coated with EC-MSC and of untreated islets from the same isolation was tested at different time points after coating (at 24 h and day 3-4). EC medium was used during the first 24 h of suspension culture; thereafter, the medium was changed to islet medium with supplements <ref type="bibr">(17)</ref>. Islets were challenged in a dynamic perifusion system, beginning with a low glucose concentration (1.67 mmol/l) during the first 36 min, followed by a high-glucose challenge (20 mmol/l) for 42 min, then reexposure to the low glucose concentration during the last 48 min. Fractions were collected at 6-min intervals over 126 min and analyzed for insulin content using commercial ELISA kits (Mercodia Insulin ELISA; Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). The area under the curve was calculated to evaluate the insulin secretion during high glucose stimulation with subtracted basal insulin secretion. Four different islet isolations with 20 islets in each condition were analyzed. Fibrin gel in vitro angiogenesis assay. Control, EC, and EC-MSC islets were placed between two layers of fibrin gel (2.5 mg/ml fibrinogen and 2 g/ml thrombin; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After polymerization, EC medium supplemented with VEGF (30 ng/ml; Peprotech) was added. The islet preparations (n &#1005; 6) were cultured for 24 h, 48 h, and 3-4 days and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Sprouts were counted manually by the same person (blinded to the composition of the islet preparation), and 4 -20 islets were counted per group in each experiment. The EC sprout length was measured using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="b02225b66c-software-3">Leica Qwin</rs> software (<rs corresp="#b02225b66c-software-3" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Leica Microsystems</rs>, Nussloch, Germany) on pictures taken on day 4 of EC and EC-MSC islets in fibrin gel. The total EC sprout length per islet was calculated for each experiment (groups of 2-10 islets, n &#1005; 6). The mean total sprout length per islet for all the experiments (n &#1005; 6) was then calculated. The frequencies of the various sprout types were calculated by analyzing micrographs of EC-MSC islets from the fibrin gel experiments (n &#1005; 6). Immunohistochemical staining. Composite and control islets were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, washed in PBS, and incubated in 20% sucrose/PBS overnight at 4&#176;C, then embedded in optimal cutting temperature medium (Tissue Tech; Sakura Finetek, Zoeterwoude, Netherlands), frozen, cryosectioned, and permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS for 15 min. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using guinea pig anti-human insulin (1:400; Fitzgerald Industries International, Concord, MA) followed by Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit (1:1,000; Molecular Probes) or Alexa Fluor 488 -conjugated mouse anti-human CD31 (1:100; Becton Dickinson). Counterstaining was performed with DAPI (10 g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Production of DsRed-expressing lentiviral particles and lentiviral vector infection of ECs. Stocks of Discosoma species-derived red fluorescent (DsRed)-expressing lentiviral vectors (Lv-DsRed) were produced by cotransfection of three plasmids, the viral core packaging construct pCMVdeltaR8.74, the VSV-G envelope protein vector pMDG.2, and the transfer vector pRRLsinPPThCMV-MCS-wpre containing DsRed cDNA (a gift of W.T. Hendriks), into human embryonic kidney 293T cells as previously described <ref type="bibr">(19,20)</ref>.</p>
        <p>HDMECs at passage 3 were seeded onto 1% gelatin-coated six-well plates (1 &#1003; 10 5 cells/well; AH Diagnostics) and cultured for 48 h. Virus at a titer of 2 &#1003;10 5 TU/ml Lv-DsRed was added to the subconfluent cells in combination with 2 g/ml Sequa-Brene (Sigma-Aldrich) in EC medium. The plate was spun for 60 min during the Lv-DsRed infection of the ECs, and, thereafter, additional fresh medium was added to the cells. The DsRed ECs were then used in the long-term islet culture experiments according to the previously described protocol for coating of islets. Image analysis and quantification. Coating, morphology, and sprout analyses were performed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510 Meta; Carl Zeiss International, Oberkochen, Germany) and/or fluorescence microscopy (Nikon Elipse E600, Nikon TS100; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Confocal z-stack images composed of 10 pictures were merged to produce a picture for use in analyzing EC adherence. Micrographs were analyzed using<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="b02225b66c-software-0">Leica Qwin</rs> software (<rs corresp="#b02225b66c-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Leica microsystems</rs>) to determine the surface area and total sprout length. The frequency of particular types of sprout composition was calculated from pictures using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="b02225b66c-software-simple-4">Adobe Photoshop</rs> software. Quantification of islet number was accomplished by the use of a stereomicroscope (Leica Microsystems), and pictures were analyzed using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="b02225b66c-software-simple-5">Adobe Photoshop</rs> software. Ingrowth of DsRed ECs into the islets was evaluated using confocal microscopy z-stack images, visualizing ECs at a defined depth of 30 m into the islets after 3 or 6 days of culture, with a majority of samples being analyzed after 6 days. A defined distance of 30 m from the islet surface was chosen to yield good confocal resolution. The presence of ECs was scored as 0 -3, with 0 indicating the absence of ECs from the islet section and scores of 1-3 indicating a scarce (1), intermediate <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>, or abundant (3) amount of ECs present. Statistical analysis. Data are presented as means &#1006; SEM. Mean values were compared using a two-tailed Wilcoxon test for paired data, with significance set at P &#1349; 0.05.</p>

        <p>METHODS -This is a retrospective (Institutional Review Board approved) analysis of 810 days of CSII and CGM data from nine youth with diabetes. All subjects used the Minimed Paradigm REAL Time System (Northridge, CA) for insulin delivery and CGM. Reports were downloaded using <rs corresp="#abfc2d771b-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Medtronic</rs> <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="abfc2d771b-software-0">CareLink</rs> software. Afternoon snacks were identified on CGM as glucose excursions beginning between 1330 and 1700 h. A glucose excursion was considered resolved when glucose levels remained steady for &#1350;15 min. Glucose excursions with incomplete CGM data or CSII suspension &#1022;15 min were discarded. Glucose excursions were identified as a snack with no insulin (SNI) or a snack with insulin (SWI) as described below, and possible snacks not fitting these criteria were excluded from analysis. SNI criteria were as follows: 1) no bolus administered within &#1006;30 min of the beginning of the glucose excursion, 2) increase in glucose level &#1350;50 mg/dl, 3) average rate of change from baseline to peak of excursion &#1350;0.8 mg/dl per minute, 4) starting glucose level &#1022;80 mg/dl (to exclude treatment of hypoglycemia), and 5) determined not to be the dinner meal. Carbohydrate contents for snacks are not known for SNI.</p>

        <p>Comparisons of preprandial GHR and OB as well as GHR/OB ratio between patients and controls were performed with Student's t-test, whereas paired t-test was used for comparisons between pre-and postprandial levels. Finally, t-test was also used to compare both pre-and postprandial levels between patients with normal and delayed GET. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square test. Furthermore the adjusted eff ect of diff erent factors [gender, age, body mass index (BMI z-score)] on GET, levels of GHR and OB, GHR/OB (pre-and postprandial) was explored using multiple regression analysis.

        <p>There is an increasing shift in higher education from teacher-centered to more interactive, student-centered teaching concepts. This is in part due to the known limitations of traditional lectures, such as low student attention or inefficient knowledge acquisition and translation <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. To foster interactive learning and student engagement, in particular with large student numbers, audience response (AR) systems are increasingly used at educational institutions worldwide <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. AR systems typically consist of an hardware transmitter ("clicker") that is controlled by the student, a radio-frequency receiver and a computer with software to display voting results during the presentation by the instructor, e.g. as histogram of responses <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. AR systems are used in a variety of ways: to increase student interaction and attention, to promote in-class discussions, to evaluate student knowledge or as formative assessments for the lecturer to adjust teaching pace and didactics <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Recent meta-analyses in health profession education showed that AR systems are favored by the vast majority of students and likely result in improved short-term and long-term knowledge outcomes <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. However, many instructors only reluctantly use AR systems in teaching. Frequently cited reasons are high acquisition and maintenance costs, logistic efforts or technical difficulties to operate AR system with different operating systems and presenter software <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. To overcome these limitations we sought to develop a novel web-based AR system that is specifically adapted to the didactic needs and economic requirements of higher education. Here we present "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-0">OnlineTED</rs>", a novel smartphone-and web-based AR system that is free-touse, platform independent and does not require hardware clicker or additional software. Based on user evaluation data, we analyzed the strengths and limitations of "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-1">OnlineTED</rs>" in comparison with a conventional AR system that is used at TUM and discuss the potential of webbased AR systems for undergraduate medical education.</p>
        <p>Programming and online database "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-2">OnlineTED</rs>" was developed and programmed by students and lecturers at TUM. <rs corresp="#f17f327707-software-12" resp="#curator" type="language">Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP)</rs> as server-side programming language was used to build a web-based <rs resp="#curator" subtype="implicit" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-12">AR system</rs> that is compatible with different operating systems. The user interface was linked to a <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-5">My Structured Query Language (MySQL)</rs> database for storage and management of user accounts and data. JavaScript was used as client-side programming language for animated features, e.g. a poll countdown function. Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) was implemented to ensure secure internet communication for the user.</p>
        <p>The AR system "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-25">OnlineTED</rs>" can be accessed via the openaccess website <rs corresp="#f17f327707-software-25" resp="#annotator7" type="url">http://www.OnlineTED.com</rs> (German version: http://www.OnlineTED.de). After log-on, the main page conveys information for the auditorium to participate in a poll (e.g. website URL for login, session token, quick response (QR) code). For the lecturer, the main page is the starting point to create, manage or commence polls. Flags link to the sub-pages "poll viewer" to start of a polling session, "quick poll" for spontaneous polls and "poll editor" to create or manage question sets (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). In the latter, new poll sets and questions in multiplechoice format can be created and saved via an online form (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). In addition, image (gif, jpg or png), movie (mov, avi or mpeg) or sound files (mp3, aac or wav) can be uploaded and saved with each question. Other media sources of the internet (e.g. http:// www.youtube.com/) can be directly embedded. In addition to prepared and saved questions sets, the lecturer can conduct spontaneous polls by choosing different rating scales (yes / no / undecided; very low -very high; excellent -insufficient; strongly agree -strongly disagree) from the "quick poll" options. Students can participate in the poll after log-on to the website with any internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet-PC, laptop). A poll is joined by entering a four-digit access code (session token) that is automatically generated and displayed for each session. Alternatively, students can scan a QR code with their mobile device. Upon session log-on, answer options are automatically displayed on the student devices (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>A ). After voting, the results are dynamically displayed in the presentation by the lecturer as growing histograms depicting the number and percentage of votes for each answer (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3B</ref>). Each poll question requires a bidirectional data transfer of approximately 0.03 Mbit. Based on the average connections speed of wireless Local Area Network (LAN) (54 MBits/s) or cellular mobile networks such as Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) (7.2 Mbit/s) <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>, "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-8">OnlineTED</rs>" enables polls with large audiences in a typical lecture hall setting.</p>
        <p>The <rs resp="#curator" subtype="implicit" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-13">AR system</rs> was programmed in <rs corresp="#f17f327707-software-13" resp="#curator" type="language">PHP</rs> as a server-sided programming language to be compatible with all operating systems without the requirement to install additional software.</p>
        <p>To evaluate the use of "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-11">OnlineTED</rs>" in higher education, the tool was tested with undergraduate medical students and instructors in lectures (average number of participants: 200&#177;50) and seminars (average number of participants: 22&#177;3) of pharmacology at TUM in the winter term of 2012/13. A conventional AR system using hardware clickers (Interwrite Cricket , Scotsdale, USA) that is routinely used for teaching at TUM served as a comparison. Information on usability and user perception of the two different AR systems was solicited through a paper survey at the end of the term. A 1-to-6 rating scale was used to assess the overall rating of "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-12">OnlineTED</rs>". The answer options were 1 "excellent", 2 "very good", 3 "good", 4 "fair", 5 "poor" and 6 "inadequat". For the comparison of "<rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-13">Online-TED</rs>" and the conventional AR systems, survey participants were asked to select the option "superior", "equal" or "inferior" for each of the categories, respectively. Study participation was voluntary and both informed consent by the participants and approval by the ethics committee of TUM were obtained. Website statistics were tracked by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-14">Google Analytics</rs> (<rs corresp="#f17f327707-software-14" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Google</rs>, Mountain View, CA).</p>
        <p>Comparison "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-16">OnlineTED</rs>" vs. conventional AR system A conventional AR system using hardware clickers (Interwrite Cricket , Scotsdale, USA) that is routinely used for teaching at TUM served as a comparison. Interwrite Cricket consists of 2.4 Ghz band radio receiver and radio transmitters (clicker). The system can manage up to 2047 clickers per receiver. The keypad of the clicker consists of six numeric and additional true and false buttons. The clickers are powered by two AAA batteries each that last approximately 20 weeks based on typical usage. The operative range of the clickers is up to 150 feet (45.7 m) from the receivers (in free space). <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-15">Interwrite Cricket software</rs> runs on <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-18">Windows</rs>, Mac and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-19">Linux</rs> and supports the generation of multiple-choice and true/false questions with a authoring software that requires installation on the computer of the presenter (<rs corresp="#f17f327707-software-15" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www.banxia.com/ prs/hardware/cricket</rs>). In contrast, "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-21">OnlineTED</rs>" is a web-based AR system that utilizes internet-enabled end devices of the audience as handsets. "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-22">OnlineTED</rs>" does not require the installation of software, is fully web-based and thus can be used on any operating system. Each poll question requires a bidirectional data transfer of approximately 0.03 Mbit, which enables the participation of large audiences evenAfter log-on, the main page conveys information for poll participation such as website URL for login, session token or quick response code. Flags link to the sub-pages "poll viewer" to start a polling session, "quick poll" for spontaneous polls and "poll editor" to create or manage question sets.with low data bandwidth. The operative range of "<rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-23">Online-TED</rs>" is not spatially limited and thus can be used for distance teaching, e.g. webinars. Sets of multiple-choice questions can be created and manage in "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-24">OnlineTED</rs>", and spontaneous polls with different rating scales (yes / no / undecided; very low -very high; excellent -insufficient; strongly agree -strongly disagree) conducted as "quick polls" options.</p>
        <p>To evaluate "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-25">OnlineTED</rs>" and compare its user acceptance with conventional AR systems, a paper-based survey was conducted with students and lecturers at TUM. 361 of 709 (51%) students participated in the survey. Of these, 203 students were in their first clinical year (third year of study) at TUM and enrolled in the course "basic pharmacology" consisting of lectures and seminars. 158 students were in the third clinical year (sixth year of study) at TUM and enrolled in the course "clinical pharmacology" thatconsisted of lectures only. The average age of the students enrolled was 23.4 (SD 3.5) years in the course "basic pharmacology" and 25.3 (SD 3.3) years in the course "clinical pharmacology". Of the lecturers, nine of ten participated in the survey. Their average age was 40.1 (SD 10.0) years.</p>
        <p>The beta-version of "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-36">OnlineTED</rs>" was made available on <rs corresp="#f17f327707-software-36" resp="#curator" type="version">November 1 st , 2012</rs> at <rs corresp="#f17f327707-software-36" resp="#annotator7" type="url">http://www.OnlineTED.com</rs> (German version: http://www.OnlineTED.de). As of February 28th, 2013, the website has been accessed by 2,997 visitors with 37,696 page hits (approximately 750 visitors and 9,424 page hits per month). The overall rating of "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-29">OnlineTED</rs>" by lecturers was "very good" (5 out of 10) or "excellent" (4 out of 10). The didactic benefit of "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-30">OnlineTED</rs>" for teaching was considered "excellent" by 6 out of 10 and "very good" by 3 out of 10 lecturers. Free text comments by the lecturers indicated that "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-31">OnlineTED</rs>" provided a "helpful basis for in-class discussions between students and lecturer". In addition, "playful discussion of topics and clinical problems", e.g. by presenting clinical cases and questions on pharmacotherapy, drug choice and clinical management were considered a key didactic benefit of AR systems. A specific advantage of "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-32">OnlineTED</rs>" was seen in the possibility to "spontaneously assess the learning and knowledge state" of the students by using the instant poll option. When asked to compare "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-33">OnlineTED</rs>" with conventional AR systems using hardware clickers, the lecturers rated "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-34">OnlineTED</rs>" superior in seven out of nine categories (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>A ). The areas with the highest advantage for lecturers were seen in time required to use the TED system for the first time, well as its flexibility (10 out of 10 and 9 out of 10, respectively). Approximately 80% (289 of 361) of the undergraduate medical students in the studied cohort at TUM indicated to own a mobile internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet-PC or iPad). Of these, the majority (92%, n=265) could access the polling session without difficulty using either wireless LAN or cellular data network during lectures or seminars. The vast majority of students (94%, n= 274) gave an overall rating for "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-35">OnlineTED</rs>" of "excellent" or "very good". "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-36">OnlineTED</rs>" was seen on par or superior in all categories when compared to conventional AR systems using hardware clickers (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4B</ref>).</p>
        <p>In this article we present "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-37">OnlineTED</rs>", a novel web-based audience response system that is free-to-use, platformindependent and does not require hardware clickers. Our aim was to develop an AR system for higher education that is on par with commercial systems with respect to functionality and usability. Surprisingly, "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-38">OnlineTED</rs>" was evaluated superior in a number of categories by both students and lecturers (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). In particular, its usability and flexibility with regard to handling, question management and in-class performance were seen as key advantages of "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-39">OnlineTED</rs>" in comparison to conventional AR systems. Finally, "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-40">OnlineTED</rs>" is a non-commerical AR system that is freely available to educators and students worldwide. A potential limitation of "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-41">OnlineTED</rs>" is its dependency on internet availability that may be limited or restricted at some university campuses due to poor WLAN coverageor cellular network reception. Another important issue is the safety of data on the internet. To address these concerns, "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-42">OnlineTED</rs>" has implemented HTTPS, a communications protocol for secure communication over a computer network that is used for sensitive data transfer e.g. electronic banking. HTTPS provides bi-directional encryption of data transfer between a client and server and authentication of the web site and associated web server <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>. As an additional safety measure, "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-43">OnlineTED</rs>" does not permit users to identify the IP address of devices used in a poll, thus assuring the anonymity of poll participants. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to investigate the concerns and attitudes of students and lecturers to web-based technology and its impact for higher education. Extensive research on AR systems in higher education has indicated their effectiveness on different learning outcomes, such as knowledge gain, student self-confidence and positive learner reactions (reviewed by <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>). The most commonly cited benefit of AR systems are the increased student engagement through active participation. However, while AR systems provide a convenient way to improve student interactivity, it is in the end pedagogy and didactic implementation that matters. In a recent study by Smith et al. <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>, students were encouraged to discuss TED clicker questions with their classmates prior to voting. The authors demonstrated that peer discussions are effective means of active learning that resulted in significantly improved conceptual understanding when used with AR systems. In this regard, the frequently cited limitation of AR systems that not all students may be able to participate in a poll due to limited numbers of clickers or internet-enabled devices may offer the opportunity for collaborative voting and peer discussions in class. Another pedagogical aspect of AR systems, which is often overlooked, is its use in formative assessment and feedback. A recent report by Alexander et al. showed that AR systems can be successfully used to monitor the progress of students in the curriculum and allow students to compare their learning progress with other classmates <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>. The omnipresence of the internet and availability of computer-based technologies open up new opportunities to actively engage students in teaching. Our survey revealed that up to 80% of undergraduate medical students at TUM posses an internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet or iPad). This results is in accordance with recent studies that 60 to 80% of UK medical students own a smartphone <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. Web-based AR systems such as "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="f17f327707-software-simple-44">OnlineTED</rs>" may thus provide a feasible alternative to conventional, hardware-based AR technology in teaching and become a suitable tool to foster interactive learning and student engagement in undergraduate medical education, in particular with large audiences.</p>

        <p>The matched dataset is then used to simulate a property tax reform that applies current market values instead of cadastral values. In a first scenario, we assess the potential revenue gain induced by the use of up-to-date property values. Next, we simulate a revenue-neutral scenario in which the additional revenue is used to lower social insurance contributions (SIC) via a lump sum SIC credit. As a third scenario, we simulate a proportional reduction of social insurance contributions, again under revenue neutrality. All simulations are carried out using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="e35b62ad79-software-simple-0">EUROMOD</rs>-the tax-benefit microsimulation model for EU member states. It allows us to evaluate changes in households' disposable income induced by the different scenarios. Our baseline simulations focus on first-order effects of the three reform scenarios. In addition, we also discuss the relevance of second-order effects in our context, and provide robustness checks in the Appendix accounting for potential labor supply responses.</p>
        <p>In addition, our results speak to the literature analyzing the distributive effects of tax shifts from labor income toward other tax bases such as consumption (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Pestel and Sommer 2017)</ref>. So far, little empirical work has been dedicated to property tax related simulations, mostly driven by data limitations. A notable exception is <ref type="bibr">Moscarola et al. (2015)</ref>, assessing labor market reactions to a property and labor tax reform in Italy. In a similar vein, <ref type="bibr">Figari et al. (2017)</ref> investigate the fiscal and distributional consequences of including homeowners' imputed rent in personal taxable income as a kind of property tax for six European countries. Using up-to-date property values to determine property taxes could be regarded as an important complement (and maybe even as a substitute depending on the specific design) to housing income taxation. Finally, <ref type="bibr">Kuypers et al. (2017)</ref> currently create a <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="e35b62ad79-software-simple-1">EUROMOD</rs> input database directly from the HFCS dataset. Their approach aims at broadening the scope of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="e35b62ad79-software-simple-2">EUROMOD</rs> by including information on wealth from HFCS, but they do not combine this with EU-SILC data. The novelty of our paper is the creation of a new dataset via statistical matching that allows analyses regarding two variables which have never been jointly observed, namely the current property tax liability and the actual market value of the property. Our approach may potentially be extended to other European countries covered by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="e35b62ad79-software-simple-3">EUROMOD</rs>, providing a fruitful avenue for further research.</p>
        <p>Our policy reform simulations are performed on <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="e35b62ad79-software-5">EUROMOD</rs> (version <rs corresp="#e35b62ad79-software-5" resp="#annotator5" type="version">G2.0</rs>), the tax-benefit microsimulation model designed for EU member states. It applies national tax-benefit policy rules to harmonized microdata and calculates their effects on household disposable income <ref type="bibr">(Sutherland and Figari 2013)</ref>. Unlike computable general equilibrium (CGE) approaches, the only assumptions we impose concern our proposed reform scenarios, or the elasticity of labor supply. Our approach is in the spirit of recent research, for instance on fiscal sustainability <ref type="bibr">(Dolls et al. 2017)</ref>, income distribution analysis <ref type="bibr">(Bargain et al. 2015)</ref>, or mortgage interest deductibility <ref type="bibr">(Figari et al. 2017</ref>). Thus, we follow well-established simulation techniques using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="e35b62ad79-software-simple-6">EUROMOD</rs>, allowing for inferences about the distributional and revenue effects of a tax shift from labor to property. The German component of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="e35b62ad79-software-simple-7">EUROMOD</rs> reproducing the 2010 German tax-benefit system has been validated through comparison with aggregate statistics provided by fiscal authorities <ref type="bibr">(Ochmann and Granados 2011)</ref>. We run all tax-benefit policy rules at their 2010 setting and then augment the model with a simulated change in property and labor taxation. Hence, our simulation model calculates household disposable income under the current as well as the reformed tax-benefit rules holding everything else constant and, therefore, avoiding endogeneity problems <ref type="bibr">(Bourguignon and Spadaro 2006)</ref>.</p>

        <p>A PFC mask was created using the normalized T1-weighted high-resolution images of all participants, which were stripped using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="a37a4e9795-software-1">BrainSuite2</rs> (<rs corresp="#a37a4e9795-software-1" resp="#curator" type="url">http://brainsuite. usc.edu</rs>). The PFC mask included Brodmann areas (BA) 9-12, 24, 25, 32, and 44-47. Only voxels within this mask were further analyzed.</p>
        <p>For each participant, a generalized linear model (GLM) was created using time-series predictors for each of the 3 amygdala subregions and 9 nuisance covariates (timeseries predictors for global signal, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and 6 motion parameters). The global signal is thought to reflect a combination of physiological processes (ie cardiac and respiratory fluctuations), and therefore, it was included in the GLM to control for such factors. Correlation analysis was carried out between the seed ROIs and PFC in a voxel-wise manner using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a37a4e9795-software-simple-2">REST</rs>. The correlation coefficients were then transformed to Z-values using the Fisher r-to-z transformation. In the first-level analysis, a 1-sample t test model was used to delineate the functional connectivity of each amygdala ROI. In the second-level random effects analysis, direct comparisons were conducted to identify differences in functional connectivity between SZ vs HC, BD vs HC, and SZ vs BD. Statistical significance was determined by a corrected P &lt; .05. Correction for multiple comparisons was made by combining individual voxel P &lt; .005 with cluster size &gt; 432mm <ref type="bibr">3</ref> , determined by the Monte Carlo simulation (<rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a37a4e9795-software-simple-3">AlphaSim</rs> command line in AFNI [analysis of functional neuroimaging; Cox, 1996] <ref type="bibr">53</ref> ). An additional Bonferroni correction (P = .005/P = .00056) was used as well, because a total of 9 two-sample t tests (SZ vs HC, BD vs HC, and SZ vs BD, multiplied by 3 ROIs) were performed. Exploratory analyses were performed to examine the correlation between the Z-values of regions showing significant group differences and symptom rating scores (the BPRS in the SZ group, and the HDRS and YMRS in the BD group). A 2-tailed P level of .05 was considered significant.</p>
        <p>Data were acquired on a GE Signa HDX 3.0T MRI scanner. A standard head coil was used with foam padding to reduce head motion. Participants were instructed to rest with their eyes closed during scanning. No participant reported falling asleep during the scan when routinely asked immediately after scanning. FMRI data were collected using a gradient-echo planar imaging sequence sensitive to BOLD contrast (TR = 2000ms, TE = 30ms, Diverse Amygdala-Frontal Connectivity in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder flip angle = 90&#176;, FOV = 24 &#215; 24cm, matrix = 64 &#215; 64). Thirty-five axial slices were collected with 3-mm thickness without gap. For spatial normalization and localization, a 3-dimensional fast spoiled gradient-echo T1-weighted sequence was used to acquire high-resolution structural images (TR = 7.1ms, TE = 3.2ms, FOV = 24 &#215; 24cm, matrix = 240 &#215; 240, slice thickness = 1.0mm without gap, 176 slices, 1 averages). Image preprocessing was carried out using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="a37a4e9795-software-100">SPM5</rs> (<rs corresp="#a37a4e9795-software-100" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm</rs>) and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a37a4e9795-software-111">Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST)</rs> (<rs corresp="#a37a4e9795-software-111" resp="#curator" type="url">http:// www.restfmri.net</rs>). Preprocessing using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a37a4e9795-software-simple-8">SPM5</rs> consisted of slice-time correction, motion correction, spatial normalization, and spatial smoothing full width at half maximum (FWHM = 6mm). Movement parameters were examined for each participant. Data sets with more than 2mm maximum translation in x, y or z, or 2&#176; of maximum rotation about 3 axes between each image were excluded. Preprocessing using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a37a4e9795-software-simple-9">REST</rs> consisted of removing linear drift through linear regression and temporal band-pass filtering (0.01-0.08 Hz) to reduce the effects of lowfrequency drifts and physiological high-frequency noise.</p>
        <p>In direct comparison between the SZ and BD groups, the SZ group showed significantly decreased rsFC between the LB amygdala and right DLPFC (BA 46/9) compared with the BD group (figure <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">1</ref>). In contrast, the BD group showed significantly decreased rsFC between the LB amygdala and pregenual ACC (BA 24) and rostral PFC (BA 10) compared with the SZ group (table <ref target="#tab_1" type="table">2</ref>; figure <ref target="#fig_2" type="figure">1</ref>). These findings correspond to a corrected P &lt; .05 by <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a37a4e9795-software-simple-10">AlphaSim</rs> correction.</p>
        <p>In direct comparison between the SZ and BD groups, the SZ group showed significantly decreased rsFC between the CM amygdala and right DLPFC (BA 46/9) compared with the BD group (table 2; figure <ref target="#fig_3" type="figure">2</ref>). These findings correspond to a corrected P &lt; .05 by <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a37a4e9795-software-simple-11">AlphaSim</rs> correction.</p>
        <p>In direct comparison between the SZ and BD groups, the SZ group showed significantly decreased FC between the SF amygdala and right DLPFC (BA 46/9) and left DLPFC (BA 46/9) compared with the BD group (figure <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">3</ref>). In contrast, the BD group showed significantly decreased rsFC between the SF amygdala and pregenual/ ventral ACC, rostral PFC (BA 24/25/32/10), and right OFC (BA 47), and left OFC (BA 47) with extension into the temporopolar area (BA 38) compared with the SZ group (table 2; figure <ref target="#fig_4" type="figure">3</ref>). These findings correspond to a corrected P &lt; .05 by <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a37a4e9795-software-simple-12">AlphaSim</rs> correction. Findings also survived Bonferroni correction for multiple t tests (P = .00056) except for those in the right ventral ACC-CM amygdala rsFC and left ventral ACC-SF amygdala rsFC in HC vs BD, right DLPFC-SF amygdala rsFC in HC vs SZ, and left pregenual ACC and rostral PFC-LB amygdala rsFC in SZ vs BD (table <ref target="#tab_1" type="table">2</ref>).</p>

        <p>Currently, there exist three different predictors publicly available: <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-11">big-&#960;</rs> (15 ) from the <rs corresp="#a3d714f4f8-software-11" resp="#curator" type="publisher">University of Vienna</rs> (available in two versions, one for metazoa and one for protozoa), <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-12">DGPI</rs> from the <rs corresp="#a3d714f4f8-software-12" resp="#curator" type="publisher">University of Geneva</rs> (retrieved from <rs corresp="#a3d714f4f8-software-12" resp="#curator" type="url">http://129.194.185.165/ dgpi</rs>/), and the large-scale annotator <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-1">GPI-SOM</rs> <ref type="bibr">(16 )</ref> from the <rs corresp="#a3d714f4f8-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">University of Bern</rs>. The first two also predict potential cleavage sites while the third does not. These tools target the C-terminal and N-terminal signals of protein sequences, or require verifying the presence of the N-terminal signal before submitting sequences to the predictor. This affects automatically their performance in the presence of fragmented or partial sequences, which happen to be more and more common in databases. In particular, metagenome projects generate many fragmented sequences representing only partial proteins, complicating the annotation process. Moreover, with metagenome projects, the inability to relate many of the new sequences to a specific taxonomic group does not favor the use of a group-specific tool like <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-7">big-&#960;</rs>. Therefore, large-scale annotation tools, which are able to predict the presence of a particular motif at different levels of precision (that is, to assess each prediction in a qualitative way) with minimal information, are then needed to address this new reality, since tools that are too restrictive or specialized often lack the flexibility needed to make correct predictions. For example, a recent analysis of the P. falciparum proteome shows that <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-8">big-&#960;</rs>, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-9">DGPI</rs>, and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-10">GPI-SOM</rs> generated poor results in predicting proteins selected as biologically validated or highly probable candidates <ref type="bibr">(14 )</ref>. Accordingly, our system was designed to offer the precision of cleavage site prediction tools and the flexibility needed for a large-scale annotator in a noisy environment.</p>
        <p>We developed a system, called <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-11">FragAnchor</rs>, based on the tandem use of a neural network (NN) and a hidden Markov model (HMM). NN is used to select potential GPI-anchored sequences and HMM classifies the selected sequences by a qualitative scoring scheme. The sequences selected by NN are annotated as highly probable (Class 1), probable (Class 2), weakly probable (Class 3), or potential false positive (Class 4). HMM is also used to predict the position of the cleavage site in the sequence.</p>
        <p>In the test performed with 30 sequences of those proposed by Gilson et al <ref type="bibr">(14 )</ref> from the P. falciparum proteome, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-12">FragAnchor</rs> was able to predict 29 of them as GPI-anchored protein sequences (96.67%). However, it is interesting to note that 40% of these predictions were classified as potential false positive (Class 4).</p>
        <p>The tests with the two negative sets gave very good results as 96.80% and 93.79% of the sequences were rejected by NN, respectively, while HMM classified most of the incorrectly selected sequences as potential false positives. These examples illustrate the importance and usefulness of the qualitative scoring of the predictions of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-13">FragAnchor</rs>.</p>
        <p>The sequences of the four test sets described above were also submitted to two publicly available predictors of GPI-anchored proteins: <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-14">big-&#960;</rs> (15 ) and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-15">GPI- SOM</rs> (16 ) <ref type="table">Table 3)</ref>. We did not compare <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-16">FragAnchor</rs> with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-17">DGPI</rs> because the design of this tool makes large dataset analysis difficult. Since <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-18">big-&#960;</rs> and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-19">GPI-SOM</rs> require the use of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-20">SignalP</rs> <ref type="bibr">(18 )</ref> for the N-terminal signal peptide prediction, we included an evaluation of<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-21">FragAnchor</rs> combined with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-22">SignalP</rs> to help the comparison process. However, the use of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-23">SignalP</rs> is not required before using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-24">FragAnchor</rs>. Compared with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-25">big-&#960;</rs>, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-26">FragAnchor</rs> is more sensitive to the GPI-anchoring pattern even if we consider only the first three classes (highly probable, probable, and weakly probable). For the first set of 121 GPI-anchored sequences, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-27">FragAnchor</rs> correctly predicted 88.43% of them (82.64% in Classes 1-3) while <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-28">big-&#960;</rs> accepted 60.33%. For the newly analyzed P. falciparum sequences, as pointed out in Gilson et al <ref type="bibr">(14 )</ref>, most predictors failed to predict a significant number of sequences known to bear GPI anchor. In <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, we can see that <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-29">FragAnchor</rs> has a very high capacity of prediction with only one sequence wrongly predicted. Even when discarding the potential false positive sequences, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-30">FragAnchor</rs> recognizes more GPI-anchored sequences than <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-31">big-&#960;</rs> does. One of the reasons of the better performance of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-32">FragAnchor</rs> is the fact that it does not need the presence of the N-terminal signal, which is not clearly detectable in 6 of the 30 P. falciparum sequences.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-33">FragAnchor</rs> shows a lower capacity of discrimination for the negative sets when compared with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-34">big-&#960;</rs>, which is understandable due to the high stringency of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-35">big-&#960;</rs>. However, this high stringency is accompanied by a poor capacity of prediction for the GPI anchor signal. Nonetheless, we achieved a specificity of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-36">FragAnchor</rs> comparable to that of <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-37">GPI- SOM</rs> and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-38">big-&#960;</rs>. The specificity was computed by adding the proportions of the first three classes (Table 2), for example, for the cytoplasm and nuclear proteins, it is 0.21 + 0.16 + 0.27 = 0.64. For the membrane transport proteins, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-39">FragAnchor</rs> gave more false positive predictions. However, for this set of proteins, it is possible that some of them will eventually be validated as real GPI-anchored proteins in laboratory experiments.</p>
        <p>When compared with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-40">GPI-SOM</rs>, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-41">FragAnchor</rs> is more accurate. <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-42">GPI-SOM</rs> predicted fewer GPIanchored sequences from the first positive set of 121 sequences, with a prediction rate of 82.64% compared with 88.43% for <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-43">FragAnchor</rs>. It also failed to predict a significant number of the P. falciparum sequences with only 73.33% of correctly predicted GPI-anchored sequences. For the negative sets, the use of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-44">FragAnchor</rs> combined with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-45">SignalP</rs> showed that <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-46">FragAnchor</rs> achieved results close to <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-47">GPI-SOM</rs> (better for the first negative set, slightly lower for the second negative set).</p>
        <p>More interestingly, the analysis of P. falciparum GPI-anchored sequences showed that a large portion of the GPI-anchored sequences (40%) fell in the potential false positive prediction, proving the usefulness of keeping those potentially wrongly predicted sequences in a specific class. An analysis of the sequences rejected by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-48">GPI-SOM</rs> showed that 50% of them were found in the potential false positive class from <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-49">FragAnchor</rs>. In addition, the analysis result of P. falciparum sequences demonstrated that 4 of the 11 biochemically validated GPI-anchored sequences did not have an N-terminal signal peptide recognized by<rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-50">SignalP</rs>. This fact confirms the effectiveness of an annotation not based on the prediction of this signal. In short, the comparison with other tools is not easy due to the uniqueness of the tandem method. However, it reveals an interesting power of prediction where, in a single run, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-51">FragAnchor</rs> can have a very low number of potential false positive predictions with a much higher number of GPI-anchored sequences predicted.</p>
        <p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, we show an example of output from the tandem system (<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-52">FragAnchor</rs> predictor). NN first selects a protein sequence and then HMM parses the sequence in order to predict a potential cleavage site. The first predicted anchor site for that sequence (5NTD HUMAN) is at position 549. This is the position annotated in the Swiss-Prot database. In the output, the predictor proposes a maximum of three possible anchor sites, ranked by decreasing scores.</p>
        <p>The comparison of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-53">FragAnchor</rs> with <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-54">big-&#960;</rs> and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-55">GPI- SOM</rs> shows that <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-56">FragAnchor</rs> can be used at different levels of precision, allowing a more selective prediction. In addition, it offers a high level of flexibility with respect to the organism considered. Studies like the P. falciparum proteome analysis by <ref type="bibr">Gilson et al (14 )</ref>, where the available predictors failed to predict the biochemically proposed new GPI-anchored proteins, show that there is a need for a more flexible and universal predictor. The flexibility and accuracy achieved by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-57">FragAnchor</rs> offer an excellent annotator for the GPI anchor signal designed for all metagenome projects.One of the main goals of this large-scale prediction tool is to offer greater flexibility to the users. We propose a tool that offers different levels of sensitivity to the GPI anchor signal. The tests reveal that the combination of the two machine learning approaches yields very good results. The tandem system is a very general (all eukaryotes) tool for the annotation of GPI-anchored proteins on a large scale by using minimal information. It produces prediction with a qualitative annotation allowing the user to choose the strength of precision that he/she wants. The less sensitive classes may contain sequences with unusual GPI anchor signals, which can yield to new discoveries in the PTM research area.</p>
        <p>The Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-64">javaNNS</rs> <rs corresp="#a3d714f4f8-software-64" resp="#annotator2" type="version">1.1</rs>) developed at the <rs corresp="#a3d714f4f8-software-64" resp="#curator" type="publisher">University of Stuttgart</rs> (<rs corresp="#a3d714f4f8-software-64" resp="#curator" type="url">http://www-ra.informatik.uni-tuebingen. de/downloads/JavaNNS</rs>/) was used to design and train our NN predictor. The learning set for this experiment is 79 sequences from the Swiss-Prot database release 49.0 that are annotated as GPIanchored proteins, with a length of the C-terminal section to be 50 a.a., and another 79 sequences of proteins that are known not to be GPI-anchored proteins. The choice of the length of the C-terminal section was based on an analysis of Swiss-Prot GPI-anchored proteins, which showed a maximum length of 45 a.a. for the C-terminal signal. To give some flexibility to the system, we selected an input vector of 50 a.a. Since neural networks accept numerical input, and given the importance of molecular weight and hydrophobicityin the anchoring process, we encoded each amino acid with its hydropathy on the Kyte and Doolitle scale <ref type="bibr">(21 )</ref>, as well as its molecular weight. The last step is the normalization of the input vectors. We have applied a simple min-max normalization:</p>
        <p>The architecture of the neural network used in <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-62">FragAnchor</rs> is a multilayered perceptron using the RPROP (Resilient Back Propagation) learning algorithm <ref type="bibr">(23 )</ref>. The input layer is composed of 100 neurons, corresponding to 2 input values for each of 50 amino acids. A hidden layer of 150 neurons encodes the classification process, and the output layer contains 1 neuron, giving a score to each sequence. The number of neurons in the hidden layer is the optimal architecture selected over different test architectures (results not shown).</p>
        <p>Based on the known structure of the GPI signal (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), we designed our HMM predictor following the approach used in <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a3d714f4f8-software-simple-63">SignalP</rs> <ref type="bibr">(18 )</ref>. The underlying graph of HMM is composed of three parts, corresponding to the GPI signal features (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). The score associated to a sequence is the log-score of the likelihood, normalized by the length of the sequence.</p>

        <p>Electrophysiological Recordings-The whole-cell and outside-out patch configurations of the patch clamp technique were used to record macroscopic and single channel currents evoked by 5-HT, respectively. Patch electrodes for both modes were filled with a solution comprising 140 mM CsCl, 0.1 mM CaCl 2 , 1.1 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 (adjusted with 1 M CsOH; final [Cs &#1001; ] o &#1005; 143 mM). The intracellular free calcium concentration of this solution was estimated to be 10 nM <ref type="bibr">(29)</ref>. The recording chamber comprised a 35-mm Petri dish on which the cells were cultivated. Using a gravity-feed system, the chamber was superfused routinely at &#1011;5 ml/min, at room temperature (20 -23&#176;C), with extracellular solutions of the compositions described below. Single channel currents evoked by pressure-applied 5-HT (10 M) were recorded in an extracellular solution (E1) consisting of 142.8 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 (adjusted by 1 M NaOH; final [Na &#1001; ] o &#1005; 146 mM). Whole-cell recording was used to determine the reversal potentials (E 5-HT ) of macroscopic currents elicited by 5-HT (10 M) by means of a voltageramp protocol using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="becfe77e27-software-0">WinWCP</rs> V<rs corresp="#becfe77e27-software-0" resp="#annotator3" type="version">3 9.6</rs> electrophysiology software (<rs corresp="#becfe77e27-software-0" resp="#curator" subtype="person" type="publisher">J. Dempster</rs>, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Strathclyde, UK; available on the World Wide Web). Unless stated otherwise, E 5-HT was determined via a protocol wherein the membrane potential was initially set at &#1002;60 mV, and a macroscopic current response to 5-HT was elicited. During the plateau of the current response, the membrane potential was stepped from &#1002;60 to &#1002;100 mV for 100 ms and subsequently ramped to &#1001;80 mV within 1 s. Care was taken to ensure that the current amplitude at the beginning and termination of the voltage ramp protocol were similar. An identical voltage ramp in the absence of 5-HT served to determine the leakage current and was subtracted from the currents evoked in the presence of 5-HT to generate the current-voltage (I-V) relationship specifically attributable to the 5-HT-evoked conductance. E 5-HT was determined from such leak-subtracted currents. In order to determine the permeability of Na &#1001; relative to Cs &#1001; (P Na /P Cs ), E 5-HT was determined in solution E1, and the permeability ratio was calculated from the Goldman-HodgkinKatz (GHK) (voltage) equation,For simplicity, we routinely refer to ion concentrations rather than activities throughout, although the latter were employed in the calculations of relative permeabilities.</p>

Dempster</rs>, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Strathclyde, UK; available on the World Wide Web), single channel current amplitude histograms were constructed from sections of single channel activity in which unitary events predominated, as described in detail previously <ref type="bibr">(20)</ref>. The &#9253; value is routinely reported as the chord conductance (i.e. &#9253; &#1005; i/(V m &#1002; E 5-HT ), where i is single channel current amplitude, V m is the holding potential (including liquid junction potential correction), and E 5-HT is the reversal potential of the agonist-evoked macroscopic response determined as described above under the appropriate ionic conditions. In the case of the 5-HT3A(QDA) D127K mutant, single channel currents could not be resolved directly in recording from outsideout membrane patches. Thus, we estimated &#9253; by fluctuation analysis of whole-cell current evoked by 5-HT (1 M) as previously described by us <ref type="bibr">(16)</ref>. A rectification index (RI) is used to describe the degree of single channel current rectification. The RI was calculated as follows,</p>

        <p>The scales forming the <rs cert="0.3" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ddd7c74769-software-simple-6">BREAST-Q</rs> reconstruction module are as follows: satisfaction with breasts, satisfaction with the overall outcome, psychosocial well-being, sexual well-being, physical well-being of the chest, satisfaction with nipple areola reconstruction, satisfaction with information, satisfaction with the surgeon, satisfaction with the medical team, and satisfaction with the office staff.</p>
        <p>The patients' responses to each scale's items were analyzed through the Q Score that analyses data based on <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ddd7c74769-software-9">RUMM</rs> <rs corresp="#ddd7c74769-software-9" resp="#annotator2" type="version">2020</rs>, a data-analyzing program developed by<rs corresp="#ddd7c74769-software-9" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Rasch Unidimensional Measurement Models Laboratory</rs>. This software automatically transforms raw data into summary scores that range from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 100 (very satisfied) for each scale. For all <rs cert="0.3" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="ddd7c74769-software-simple-10">BREAST-Q</rs> scales, a higher score indicates greater satisfaction or better quality of life. A mean change of 5 to 10 on a multi-item scale is perceived as "a little" change, 10 to 20 as "a moderate" change, and greater than 20 as "a maximal" change.</p>
        <p>Before commencing the study, the questionnaire had a Czech translation validated in accordance with the agreement with the MAPI Trust (http:// www.mapi-trust.org/).

        <p>Several reports have demonstrated that the VITEK 2 GN card misidentifies P dagmatis as P pneumotropica or P canis, despite an excellent identification probability <ref type="bibr">(9,15,23,24)</ref>. This is most likely because P dagmatis has not been included in the system database; as well, there has been a nomenclature change because P dagmatis was formerly grouped with P pneumotropica, type Henriksen. In a study that included 66 clinical Pasturella isolates and used sodA gene sequencing as a reference method, Zangenah et al <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref> revealed that VITEK 2 only identified approximately 50% of Pasturella isolates correctly, while conventional biochemical tests and MALDI-ToF MS were able to correctly identify 94% and 89%, respectively. Interestingly, in the Zangenah et al <ref type="bibr">(24)</ref> study, two P dagmatis isolates were not identified by VITEK MS MALDI-ToF (BioMerieux, France) and this limitation was also observed in our study (data not shown). The biological and genetic profiles among P dagmatis, P pneumotropica and P stomatis are very similar <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref>; both a commercial biochemical identification system and the sequence analysis of a portion of the 16S rRNA gene were unable to differentiate between these species.</p>
        <p>Correct identification was made using MALDI-ToF MS (MALDI Biotyper, Bruker, Germany) and was also supported by comparing the key biochemical characteristics among P dagmatis, P pneumotropica and P stomatis <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). It is probable that many clinical isolates of P dagmatis have been misidentified due to the limitation of commercial biochemical identification systems, such as VITEK 2. Misidentification may have contributed to an underestimation of the frequency of this organism in clinical samples; however, the growing use of MALDI-ToF MS systems for microorganism identification in routine clinical microbiology laboratories may allow for a more accurate picture of how frequently P dagmatis causes infections. Correct identification is important for diagnosis and therapeutic management, and epidemiological monitoring of the transmission of Pasturella species, particularly for the systemic infections such as in the present case. Unfortunately, most routine methods available at hospital laboratories cannot identify the organism correctly.</p>
        <p>P dagmatis can cause severe animal-associated infections in humans, mainly in immunocompromised individuals. To our knowledge, this is the first systemic P dagmatis infection reported in Canada. Clinical outcomes rely on early accurate laboratory confirmation and timely administration of effective antibiotic treatment. Conventional identification of P dagmatis using VITEK 2 can be misleading, probably due to the absence of this organism from the database; 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and MALDI-ToF MS systems represent excellent options for identifying rarely encountered or difficult to identify organisms, such as members of the Pasturellaceae family. The present study re-emphasizes the need for continuously improving the database of automatic microbial identification systems.</p>

At the end of data collection, an offline sequence of the respiratory cycles of the subjects was selected to accommodate a variation of ,15% for expiratory tidal volume and of ,5% for ETCO 2 tension. Respiratory cycles that had Slp2 and Slp3 equal to zero were excluded. The main variables analyzed were ETCO 2 , Slp2, Slp3, inspiratory time (T i ), expiratory time (T e ), and expiratory volume (V e ).

        <p>Methods. Identification of prior research studies was performed using the search terms: anxiety; BC; marital relationship; spouse; MQ; Middle East; and KSA in various combinations. These search words were entered into PubMed and <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="ead0656800-software-simple-0">Google Scholar</rs> to locate all relevant studies. A convenience sample of women with BC (volunteers) was recruited between January 2013 and March 2013 from King Abdulaziz University's (KAU) Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Al-Amoudi Breast Cancer Center of Excellence in Jeddah, KSA. Consecutive women presenting to the outpatient clinic for initial assessment or follow-up were approached for inclusion in the study. The inclusion criteria were: age 18 to 65 years; diagnosis of BC documented in the medical record; currently married; and attending the clinic on the day that the interviewers were present in the clinic. The exclusion criteria were women without BC, those outside the age range above, those who were not currently married, and all those being seen on days and times when interviewers were not present. The average length of time that participants were diagnosed with and/or experienced symptoms of BC were 38.4 months (range 2 weeks to 180 months). The questionnaire was translated into Arabic, and was self-completed by participants. Medical students (trained by KAU psychiatry faculty on how to approach patients, obtain consent, and administer the questionnaire) explained the study to the participants and obtained informed consent before proceeding. The institutional review board of KAU Hospital approved the study following the principles of the Helsinki Declaration.</p>
        <p>Statistical analyses. The characteristics of the sample were described by means + standard deviations (SD) or percentages <ref type="table">Table 1)</ref>. A correlation matrix (Pearson r) was constructed for all study variables <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). In multivariate analyses, income was dichotomized into low (&lt;3,000=0) versus high (&gt;3,000=1), and education was dichotomized into low (0=no education or only primary school) versus high (one=high school or beyond). Blocks of independent variables were entered in a stepwise fashion into 3 general linear models predicting the dependent variable (anxiety symptoms): model one included only the sample demographics (age, nationality, education, employment, income); model 2 included demographics and cancer-related factors; and model 3 included demographics, cancerrelated factors, and overall MQ <ref type="table">Table 3)</ref>. Given the sample size, only independent variables significant at p&lt;0.10 were carried forward into later models. Since these analyses were largely exploratory, the significance level was set at p=0.05, and analyses were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. All analyses were performed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="ead0656800-software-2">Statistical Analysis System</rs> version <rs corresp="#ead0656800-software-2" resp="#annotator8" type="version">9.3</rs> (<rs corresp="#ead0656800-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">SAS Institute Inc</rs>., Cary, North Carolina, USA).</p>

        <p>A total of 2095 RNA structure entries were reported by the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="db3ab4eff6-software-simple-0">PDB</rs> search engine in July, 2011. We have developed a software in<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="db3ab4eff6-software-simple-1">GNU-Octave</rs>, which is similar to <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="db3ab4eff6-software-simple-2">MATLAB</rs> scripting language, that i) Programmatically examines and reads the information of all the RNA structures from the PDB files and classifies them, ii) Creates the necessary database files, and iii) Creates the web-layout of HTML pages displayed in the server containing major information of each RNA chain.</p>
        <p>As the classification shows, there are many RNA classes where the numbers of PDB files are 10 or greater. These subclasses have been shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> and corresponding MOL_ID's are shown as a suffix to the PDB-ID. They carry signatures that may indicate variations introduced in the molecular structure due to ligand binding or alteration of crystallization conditions. Eventually, they can be referred to as crystallographic ensembles in analogy with statistical ensembles obtained from molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations as done recently <ref type="bibr">(Halder and Bhattacharyya, 2010; Samanta et al., 2010)</ref>. We have performed pair-wise secondary structure comparison for these classes to compare the structural similarity between them. For secondary structure assignment, the base pairing patterns of each RNA structure in a functional class have been obtained using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="db3ab4eff6-software-simple-3">BPFind</rs> software tool <ref type="bibr">(Das et al., 2006)</ref>. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="db3ab4eff6-software-simple-4">BPFind</rs> gives us the secondary structure of a nucleic acid at the basepairing level. These secondary structural information of basepairing for each chain have been converted to a one-dimensional string of characters: H, N, T, and L corresponding to Watson-Crick base pairs, non-canonical base pairs, base triplets, and unpaired www.frontiersin.orgbases, respectively. The secondary structures thus obtained correspond to individual RNA chains separately and do not consider inter-chain base pairing information. These secondary structural sequences are then compared with that of the best representative structure of that class using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm <ref type="bibr">(Needleman and Wunsch, 1970)</ref> as implemented in <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="db3ab4eff6-software-simple-5">EMBOSS</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Rice et al., 2000)</ref>. An identity scoring matrix (EDNAMAT) was used for such alignment with a gap-open penalty of &#8722;10.0 and gap-extension penalty of -0.5. We find that the average similarity is 80% or more for a set of similar structures of a given class having 30 or more RNA chains. The detailed analyses of structural variation among these crystallographic ensembles are beyond the scope of this paper and would be presented elsewhere. Here a point to note is that secondary structure comparison have not been performed for crystal structures with resolution worse than 3.5&#197; because of the poor quality of secondary structural information obtained from such structures. RNA structures solved by NMR spectroscopy or electron microscopy are also not included in secondary structure comparison for the same reason.Comparison of secondary structure can also be useful to predict the functions of unannotated RNAs. As mentioned in the earlier section, the functional types of many RNA chains that have been placed under the other-RNA and unannotated-RNA classes could not be obtained from the PDB files unambiguously.</p>
        <p>However, we find that there are a number of structures in these two types, which are of significant length (30 nucleotide or more). We have performed structural comparison of these RNA chains with known functional RNAs available in the suggested nonredundant dataset, consisting of only X-ray crystal structures with www.frontiersin.org resolution better than 3.5&#197;. For the secondary structure alignment, the basepairing pattern for each RNA structure in the non-redundant dataset, obtained using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="db3ab4eff6-software-simple-6">BPFind</rs> software, comprises a database of known structural forms of well-classified functional RNAs. In a similar way, the secondary structural data for each of the unannotated RNA chains were generated and compared against the database of known structural forms. Thus, the secondary structural information of an unannotated RNA chain has been aligned with secondary structural information of each RNA chain present in the non-redundant dataset using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment. We have assigned probable function of an unannotated RNA as identical to some known structural form with which the best similarity score is obtained. For example, chain A of 1FIR shows highest score of 362 against chain A of 1EVV <ref type="table">Table 4)</ref>.</p>

The General de Gaulle government in France followed suit, declaring that the state "must hold the levers of command." Similarly, after the independence of India, Prime Minister Nehru often evoked the commanding-heights metaphor. Typically, these countries, as well as Germany, Korea, Japan, many Latin American countries, and of course, all socialist countries, had strong state control/ownership over strategic sectors such as defense, iron and steel, railroads, ship-building, utilities, and telecom. In these sectors, the key consideration for decentralization is likely not to utilize local information but to ensure the benefits of "strategic control." Here the force of distance in decentralization should naturally be more muted.</p>

In the PreXion device, the phantom was scanned following an image acquisition protocol of 5-cm &#215; 5-cm FOV, 19 seconds, and a 0.1-mm voxel size. Thereafter, multiplanar reformatting was performed, thereby obtaining axial sections with a thickness of 1.0 mm.

For each axial image, measurements were made in either horizontal direction (the A-B distance) and in either vertical direction (the C-D distance), twice, with a 1-week interval, by 4 examiners (4 oral radiologists) with 5 years or more experience in the use of these measuring tools.

Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) calculations were used to verify intraobserver and interobserver agreement and to compare the accuracy (reproducibility) of the i-CAT and PreXion CBCT with the real measurements (the gold standard). The linear measurements (mm) were subjected to descriptive analysis to present the absolute and relative errors (in %) of the measurements performed on the acquisitions made with both CBCT machines in relation to the gold standard.

RT-PCR <ref type="bibr">(3,28)</ref> and Western blot <ref type="bibr">(3,29)</ref> were as described. Genespecific primer sets are listed in supplemental <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Primary antibodies to pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)4, uncoupling protein (UCP)-3, CD36, and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). DGAT activity was measured in vitro using [ 14 C]-labeled palmitoyl-CoA as previously described <ref type="bibr">(29,30)</ref>. The method to quantify muscle triglyceride content was as described <ref type="bibr">(3,29)</ref>. Statistical analysis. Statistical differences were first analyzed by ANOVA to determine overall treatment effects (genotype or exercise), followed by post hoc comparisons between concerned study groups (Statistica V6.0, StatSoft, OK). A two-tailed P value of &#1021;0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance. For indirect calorimetry measurements, ANOVA repeated measures (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator25" type="software" xml:id="d819df3fcb-software-3">Prism</rs>,<rs corresp="#d819df3fcb-software-3" resp="#curator" type="publisher">GraphPad Software</rs>, San Diego, CA) were used.

        <p>Determination of the motivation level and the analysis of motivation factors in the enterprises in a perticular time were carried out through a questionnaire which consists of 30 closed questions <ref type="bibr">(Hitka 2009: 149)</ref>. The questionnaire was divided into two parts. Sociodemographic and quali fication characteristics of employees were searched in the first part. Basic data about respondents relating to their age, sex, seniority, completed education and job position were obtained in this part. The second part consisted of individual motivation factors through which information about work environment, working conditions, applied appraisal and reward system, about personnel management, health and social care system and system of employee benefits as well as information about employee satisfaction or dissatisfac tion, value orientation, relation to work and enterprise or coworkers' relationship in the enterprise can be found out. Motivation factors are in alphabetical order not to affect respondents's decision. In the questionnaire respondents evaluated individual motivation factors by one of the five levels of importance from a predefined 5point rating scale, 5 -the most important and 1 -unimportant <ref type="table">(Table 1</ref>) from a predefined evaluation scale <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>.Each motivation factor was marked by employees with one of five types of importance for required as well as for cur rent conditions. The required condition can be defined as an idea of employees how the motivation should look like, i.e. what would motivate them to increase their performance. The current conditions represents the employees' opinion how they are satisfied with current motivation in the enterprise. The questionnaires were evaluated using the programme <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="d3ec996242-software-1">STATISTICA</rs> <rs corresp="#d3ec996242-software-1" resp="#annotator14" type="version">7</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Statsoft 2004)</ref>. Descriptive statistics was used to describe the primary sampling unit. Statistical character istics, which compressed information about studied primary sampling units into smaller number of numerical character istics and made mutual comparison of sampling units easier, were computed for each motivation factor. Each motivation factor was described in summary by basic characteristics of size and variability of quantitative features -average x &#61559; , stand ard deviations s x and coefficients of variation. Subsequently the results of the enterprises were compared.</p>

        <p>First we calculate the descriptive statistics for all independent variables for the total sample, as well as two subsamples: those who never experienced a pregnancy scare, and those who experienced a pregnancy scare <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref>. Independent samples' t-tests indicate whether the independent variables are statistically different in the two subsamples. Next we investigate these characteristics in a multivariate context, using logistic regression for models of experiencing any pregnancy scare, and Poisson regression for models of the number of pregnancy scares <ref type="table">(Table 3)</ref>. Lastly, we estimate hazard models, implemented using logistic regression, to illustrate the relationship between a pregnancy scare and subsequent unintended pregnancy <ref type="table">(Table 4</ref>). All analyses were conducted in <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator18" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="b1c70ff562-software-0">Stata</rs> <rs corresp="#b1c70ff562-software-0" resp="#annotator18" type="version">12.1</rs> using the logit, poisson, and xtlogit commands. The hazard models were estimated with xtlogit to account for the clustering effect of multiple journals per respondent. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows that, overall, sociodemographic characteristics associated with disadvantage are overrepresented in the subsample of young women who experienced a pregnancy scare. For example, while only 32% of those who did not experience a pregnancy scare are African American, 54% of those who experienced a pregnancy scare are African American. Also, young women with early pregnancy-related experiences are overrepresented in the pregnancy scares subsample.</p>

        <p>To understand more about the actual effect of patents in the real world, consider the recent purchase by Google of Motorola Mobility, primarily for its patent portfolio-not for the ideas and innovations in that portfolio. Few if any changes or improvements to <rs corresp="#a9b5a62ee5-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Google</rs>'s <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="a9b5a62ee5-software-0">Android operating system</rs> will result from the ownership or study of these software patents. Google's purpose in obtaining this patent portfolio is purely defensive: it can be used to countersue Apple and  Microsoft and blunt their legal attack on Google. These remarks apply to the vast bulk of patents: they do not represent useful innovation at all and are just weapons in an arms race. This is not news: the same message emerged decades ago from the <ref type="bibr">Levin, Klevorick, Nelson, and Winter (1987)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Cohen, Nelson, and Walsh (2000)</ref> surveys of research and development managers. surveys of research and development managers.</p>

        <p>When done correctly, the survival rates in mice (male: age 8-10 weeks, 22-28g; female: age 10-12 weeks, 20-26g) are: over 90% in acute ischemia/reperfusion and ischemic preconditioning experiments, over 85% in permanent artery ligation studies, and approximately 80% for intramyocardial injections. Since early injury is more readily visible by metabolic changes rather than structural, infarct size determination in ischemia/reperfusion and ischemic preconditioning experiments is performed by infusing 1% Evan's blue dye into the aorta which will perfuse the heart that is not supplied by the LAD <ref type="figure">(Figure 1A)</ref>. Once the heart is removed and transversely cut in half, the tissue is incubated in 1% solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride to measure infarct size <ref type="figure">(Figure 1B)</ref>. The areas are measured using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="d04430056f-software-simple-0">Scion</rs> or <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="d04430056f-software-simple-1">NIH imaging</rs> software which can be calibrated using a micrometer imaged at the same magnification. These numbers are used to calculate area at risk/left ventricle and infarct size/area at risk <ref type="bibr">11</ref>. Strain differences can result in variations in body weight and heart size and so care should be taken to normalize these measures to heart weight, body weight, or tibia length for comparative purposes.</p>
        <p>Permanent artery ligation results in gross structural changes such as necrosis, wall thinning, and chamber dilation. Comparison of the effects of treatment and/or time on infarct size and necrosis relative to the left ventricle, chamber area, septal wall and left ventricular free wall thickness in the permanent occlusion model <ref type="figure">(Figure 2A)</ref> can also be measured using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="d04430056f-software-simple-2">Scion</rs> or <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="d04430056f-software-simple-3">NIH imaging</rs> software. Collagen staining with picrosirius red/ fast green <ref type="figure">(Figure 2B)</ref> can be used to measure insterstitial fibrosis which correlates to functional indices of wall stiffening <ref type="bibr">8-10</ref>. The image in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> represents the distribution of 6ul solution (Evan's blue) injected into the border zone of the heart following permanent artery ligation. Notice that it proceeds in the direction of the injury as well as toward the base and also transmurally.</p>

        <p>For each organism considered in the study (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens), a specific gene-GO association file was downloaded from the website of the GO Annotation project of the European Bioinformatics Institute (August 13, 2009) from http://www .geneontology.org/GO.current.annotations.shtml. Additionally, on the sameThe hypothesis that the GOI belongs to the population of the random gene sets is tested and a P-value is returned. In addition, users may choose from several visualization tools to discover more about the functional relationships between the GOI. day an ontology file was downloaded from http://archive.geneontology.org/ latest-termdb/go_daily-termdb.obo-xml.gz. The definition file was also downloaded from the GO website and it was used to construct a DAG in the biological process subspace. We have developed a  <rs corresp="#a4367c2269-software-0" resp="#curator" type="language">Python</rs> <rs resp="#curator" subtype="implicit" type="software" xml:id="a4367c2269-software-0">library</rs> with a set of application programming interfaces for building different GOrelated graphs and performing various queries <ref type="bibr">(Muller et al., 2009)</ref>. This library is based on the <rs resp="#curator" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="a4367c2269-software-1">Python</rs> package <rs cert="1.0" corresp="#a4367c2269-software-1" resp="#annotator26" subtype="component" type="software" xml:id="a4367c2269-software-simple-3">NetworkX</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Hagberg et al., 2008)</ref>. In a graph representation of the GO, referred to as GOGraph, each node (vertex) represents a GO term and each directed edge corresponds to the IS_A relationship between a parent-child GO term pair. The directed edges between terms represent their semantic relationship such that the concept of a parent node subsumes those of its children nodes. Hence, the constructed GOGraph obeys the 'true path rule' or in other words the pathway from a child term to the most top-level parent is always true. Then, genes are added as another type of node to the GOGraph via an edge to its associated GO term(s) to create the GOGeneGraph. The GOGeneGraph is further modified by the addition of edges between terms that share the same gene annotations. Associating GO terms with the genes they annotate enables the calculation of semantic distance for edges from a GOGraph using the established methods, see Section 2.2 for details. After initialization of the edge distances, the graph is further transformed into a weighted, undirected graph, so that the functional coherence of list of GO terms can be reflected by connectivity and distances among the terms rather than the directionality. The algorithm for constructing a GOGeneGraph is detailed in Supplementary Algorithm 1.</p>

Subsequently, the cells were treated with chemicals and imaged on the temperature-controlled stage top incubator (Tokai Hit Co., Shizuoka, Japan) of fluorescent microscopy IX81 (Olympus Corp.) with a &#1003;60 oil, NA 1.35 objective at 37&#176;C under 5% CO 2 . Temperature and CO 2 concentration were maintained with an INUG2A control unit (Tokai Hit Co.). <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-9">MetaMorph</rs> Software (<rs corresp="#dae3fcfebd-software-9" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Devices</rs>, Downingtown, PA) was used to control image acquisition and manipulation. For time-lapse observation, images were recorded as described previously by Sakaushi et al. <ref type="bibr">(23)</ref>.</p>
        <p>Conformational Sampling of AMF-26-Conformational analysis of AMF-26 was performed on an Apple Power Mac G5 (PowerPC G5, 2.5 GHz; two central processing units), using the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-10">Conformational Analyzer with Molecular Dynamics and Sampling (CAMDAS)</rs> <rs corresp="#dae3fcfebd-software-10" resp="#annotator2" type="version">2.1</rs> program <ref type="bibr">(27)</ref>. Ten molecular dynamic (MD) calculations were simultaneously performed using different initial structures. Each of the MD calculations was carried out for 1 ns with an integral time step of 1 fs. The lengths of the covalent bonds were fixed. The temperature of the system was maintained at 1,200 K to enhance the sampling efficiency. Conformers were sampled every 100 steps, and then each conformer was minimized until the root mean square of the gradients of the potential energy was below 0.001 kcal mol &#1002;1 &#197; &#1002;1 . All conformations were clustered with torsion angles of heavy atoms using a threshold of &#1006;30&#176;. The Merck Molecular Force Field 94s was used to evaluate the potential energy surface of the molecule <ref type="bibr">(28, 29)</ref>. The dielectric constant was 80, but no cut-off distance for non-bonded interactions was used. Because of the low probability of the existence of conformers with higher energies, the conformers within 15 kcal mol &#1002;1 of the minimum energy of the molecule were adopted for superposition.</p>
        <p>Molecular Modeling of the Arf1-AMF-26-Sec7 Domain Complex-To obtain the initial structure of the Arf1-AMF-26-Sec7 domain complex, the sampled conformers of AMF-26 were superposed onto BFA in the X-ray structure of the Arf-BFA-Sec7 domain complex (PDB code 1r8q) (8) using the parallel version of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-simple-4">SUPERPOSE</rs> program <ref type="bibr">(30)</ref>. This superposes two molecules based on the physicochemical properties of the atomic groups, which is useful for estimating the binding conformation of a molecule by distinguishing it from the many conformations that are generated by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-simple-5">CAMDAS</rs>. The program considers five types of physicochemical property: hydrophobic (HP), aromatic (AR), hydrogen-bond donors (HD), hydrogenbond acceptors (HA), and hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors (DA). Each type is represented as a sphere with a predefined radius (1.0 or 0.5 &#197;) and is assigned to a functional group in a molecule <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4, A and B)</ref>. After molecular superposition, the matching spheres were scored using the scoring matrix (supplemental <ref type="table">Table S1)</ref>. One AMF-26 conformation was chosen as the binding conformation based on the scores and the overlapped molecular volumes <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4C)</ref>. The superposition calculations were performed using 28 nodes of a Dell PowerEdge 1950III (Intel Quad Core Xeon X5460; 3.16 GHz; 56 central processing units in total). The overlapped molecular volumes were calculated by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-11">SYBYL</rs> <rs corresp="#dae3fcfebd-software-11" resp="#annotator2" type="version">7.3</rs> (<rs corresp="#dae3fcfebd-software-11" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Tripos Inc</rs>., St. Louis, MO) on an Hewlett Packard work station xw8200 (Intel Xeon; 3.60 GHz; 2 central processing units).</p>
        <p>To relieve the steric hindrances, the coordinates of AMF-26 and of the residues within 4 &#197; from AMF-26 were optimized to reduce the root mean square of the gradients of potential energy below 0.05 kcal mol &#1002;1 &#197; &#1002;1 using <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-simple-9">SYBYL</rs>. The simplex minimization method before the conjugate-gradient minimization procedure was used. The Tripos force field was employed for the molecular energy calculation.

The cut-off distance for the non-bonded interactions was 8 &#197;. The distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4r was used. The initial positions of the missing atoms in the crystal structure were generated by the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-simple-12">SYBYL</rs>.</p>
        <p>Molecular Dynamics Simulation for Model Refinement-To refine the model of the Arf1-AMF-26-Sec7 domain complex,<rs cert="0.5" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-17">AMBER</rs> <rs corresp="#dae3fcfebd-software-17" resp="#annotator2" type="version">9</rs> (36) was used for further minimization and MD simulations on 7 nodes of an Appro 1122Hi (AMD Opteron 248; 2.20 GHz; 14 central processing units in total). The ff99 <ref type="bibr">(37)</ref> and gaff <ref type="bibr">(38)</ref> force fields were used for the proteins and AMF-26, respectively. The partial charges for AMF-26 were derived from the restraint electrostatic potential method (39) using an ab initio calculation at the HF/6 -31G* level using Gaussian 03 <ref type="bibr">(40)</ref>. The complex was solvated in a box of 34616 TIP3P (41) water molecules. Six K &#1001; ions were added to neutralize the system. The system was minimized until the root mean square of the gradients of potential energy was below 0.005 kcal mol &#1002;1 &#197; &#1002;1 . The 3.5-ns MD simulation was carried out at constant pressure (1 atm) and temperature (310 K), under periodic boundary conditions, and with particle-mesh Ewald treatment (42) of electrostatics. SHAKE <ref type="bibr">(43)</ref> was applied to all bonds involving hydrogen, and a time step of 1 fs was used. An 8-&#197; cutoff was used for the nonbonded interactions.</p>
        <p>Immunofluorescence Microscopy-After being cultured in a 24-well glass bottom plate for 48 h, cells were treated with chemicals for various periods of time (as indicated in the relevant figure). Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with cold 3.8% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) for 20 min, and then washed and permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated in blocking buffer containing 1% BSA and 2% normal goat serum (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 30 min before overnight incubation at 4&#176;C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. After being washed, cells were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies. Cells were then washed, stained with DAPI (Molecular Probes), and mounted with fluorescent Novel Golgi Inhibitor Shows Potent Antitumor Activity mounting medium (Dako). The immunostained cells were imaged using a fluorescent microscope IX81 (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with a &#1003;100 oil, NA 1.40 objective or with a &#1003;40, NA 0.95 objective, and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-18">MetaMorph</rs> Software (<rs corresp="#dae3fcfebd-software-18" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Molecular Devices</rs>, Sunnyvale, CA).</p>
        <p>Comparison between the BFA and AMF-26 Complexes-To support this conclusion, we performed computer modeling/MD simulations. The octahydronaphthalene ring of AMF-26 (HP1, HP2, and DA1) was superimposed onto the lactone ring of BFA (HP1, HP2, and HA1) by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="dae3fcfebd-software-simple-17">SUPERPOSE</rs> <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4C)</ref>.

The amplified PCR product (619 bp) was purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The PCR product was sequenced with an ABI Prism 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

        <p>Statistical analysis. Data were subjected to an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and means were compared using Tukey's test at p &lt; 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="f65719e8e2-software-4">SigmaPlot</rs> (<rs corresp="#f65719e8e2-software-4" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Systat Software Inc</rs>., San Jose, CA, USA).</p>
        <p>The ITS sequence of the P. menonorum KNU-3 isolate was 100% identical to the culture collection NRRL: 50410 of P. menonorum S. W. Peterson sp. nov (GenBank accession No. HQ646591). The phylogenetic analysis of KNU-3 was carried out by distance tree construction. The ITS1 sequence of KNU-3 was aligned with sequences of available P. menonorum strains and its nearest species through the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="f65719e8e2-software-simple-6">BLAST</rs> sequence using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f65719e8e2-software-simple-7">MultAlin</rs> program, and a neighbor-joining tree was constructed from the aligned sequences. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolate was grouped with a reference isolate of P. menonorum with 99% bootstrap value support <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>, and was distinct from other Penicillium spp., which were grouped in distinct clades. These results indicate that the isolate KNU-3 is closely related to P. menonorum. Based on morphological properties, sequence homology, and phylogenetic analysis, the isolate KNU-3 was thus identified as P. menonorum. PGP traits. P. menonorum KNU-3 was able to produce siderophores in the plate-based assay as evidenced by the formation of a yellow zone on the CAS agar medium plate <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 1A)</ref>. While the fungal isolate produced a significant amount of IAA (9.7 mg/L), no ACC deaminase activity was detected. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, P-solubilization increased from day 2 to day 6 with a value ranging from 198 to 408 mg/L <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 1B)</ref>. The pH of the medium decreased up to 6 days ranging from 6.2 to 5.1 with an increase of soluble P. After 5 days of incubation, soluble P decreased slowly with a concomitant slight pH increase of the medium <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>.</p>
        <p>Numerous microfungi were isolated in the present study to investigate the fungal community in Jeongseon, Gangwondo, Korea. Among these isolates, one Penicillium sp. showed definitive similarity matches with P. menonorum. In order to confirm the morphological results, molecular identification of the isolate was carried out based on ITS sequence analysis. The ITS sequence of the isolate was compared to the GenBank database sequences by using the NCBI-<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator1" type="software" xml:id="f65719e8e2-software-simple-8">BLAST</rs> search program, and it was found to be identical to the type strain NRRL: 50410 of P. menonorum S.W. Peterson sp. nov. In addition, the phylogenetic tree revealed that the isolate was grouped in a distinct clade together with P. menonorum with bootstrap support value of 100% <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2)</ref>. Morphological and molecular characteristics of the isolate were in agreement with the description by Peterson et al. <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. P. menonorum S.W. Peterson sp. nov. is a phenotypically and genotypically broadly circumscribed new species that was first isolated from garden soil in southern California by Peterson et al. <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>, and P. menonorum isolation from Panax ginseng has been reported in China <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, this study presents the first record of P. menonorum in Korea. Many microbial-based agricultural techniques have been developed to exploit potential mechanisms for the enhancement of crop production in different soils. Although members of the genus Penicillium are common opportunistic pathogens in the soil environment, some Penicillium strains associated with the different plant rhizospheres are able to solubilize inorganic insoluble P salts and promote plant growth in the soil. Thus, the growth-promoting capacity of P. menonorum KNU-3 was evaluated by assaying for IAA and siderophore production, ACC deaminase activity, and P solubilization. IAA secreted by microorganisms promotes root growth through a direct stimulatory effect on plant cell elongation or cell division <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>. In the present study, P. menonorum KNU-3 was positive for both IAA and siderophore production. Other researchers have made similar observations for the IAA production by Penicillium sp. <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>. Siderophores are important metabolites released by the PGP microorganisms that directly alleviate irondeficiency by increasing the supply of iron to the plant and indirectly depriving fungal pathogens of iron <ref type="bibr">[30, 31]</ref>. Kang et al. <ref type="bibr">[32]</ref> reported that siderophores are also able to chelate Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , and Al 3+ from a soil solution. In this study, the isolate showed both IAA production and the presence of siderophores, which may provide an explanation for its PGP activity. Several studies have demonstrated that production of siderophores, other secondary metabolites, and lytic enzymes by Penicillium spp. were most effective in promoting plant growth and controlling plant root pathogens.</p>

After 48 h, cells were removed from the TCR stimulation and recultured at a concentration of 5 &#215; 10 5 cells/ml in media supplemented with 100 U/ml rhIL-2. Every 24 h, viable cells were counted and readjusted to 5 &#215; 10 5 cells/ml with fresh media containing the corresponding amount of rhIL-2. <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1) ( 12, 13 )</ref>. We therefore further fractionated the positively selected CD8 + T cells from Runx3 KO mice into CD8 + CD4 &#1002; SP or CD8 + CD4 + DP cells by separation using anti-CD4 magnetic beads. This yielded a Runx3 KO SP " enriched " population that contained 75% CD8 + CD4 &#1002; cells and a KO DP enriched population that contained 85% CD8 + CD4 + cells <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1)</ref>. The cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 for 2 d before removing them from the TCR stimulus and culturing them in media containing 100 U/ml IL-2. As previously reported, TCR-induced proliferation of Runx3 &#1002; / &#1002; CD8 + T cells was severely impaired, irrespective of CD4 expression <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1) ( 12, 13 )</ref>. However, the Runx3 &#1002; / &#1002; cells showed cell-surface expression patterns indicative of activated cells, including up-regulation of CD25 and CD69 <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1)</ref>. As expected from their ability to up-regulate CD25, Runx3 &#1002; / &#1002; CD8 + T cells responded to IL-2 supplementation after day 2 and effi ciently expanded until day 6 of the culture period, albeit at slower rates compared with WT cells <ref type="figure">(Fig. S1)</ref>. Although a fraction of the KO DP cells silenced CD4 expression after activation, the ratio of SP/DP cells in each enriched population remained constant thereafter, and we did not observe any major diff erences between these two populations throughout the culture period, indicating that in terms of eff ector CTL diff erentiation and under our culture conditions, Runx3 &#1002; / &#1002; CD8 + T cells that also coexpress CD4 are indistinguishable from those that do not. The data presented in <ref type="figure">Fig. S2</ref> FACS-based cytotoxicity assay. To measure cytotoxicity, EL4 thymoma target cells were loaded with 0 or 1 &#956; M Gp33 peptide for 2 h before a 2-h coincubation with P14 CD8 + T cells at the eff ector-to-target ratios indicated in the fi gures in 96-well round-bottom plates. After the coincubation period, cells were stained with Annexin V -FITC and anti-CD8 -allophycocyanin. Data analysis was performed with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator0" type="software" xml:id="ef09459b66-software-0">FlowJo</rs> software (<rs corresp="#ef09459b66-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Tree Star, Inc</rs>.); EL4 target cells (CD8-negative events) were gated, and the percentage of Annexin V + target cells was determined.</p>

        <p>E2F7 is a direct target of miR-26a and is upregulated in AML. We previously showed that miR-26a negatively regulates cell proliferation and stimulates myeloid differentiation of AML cells. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> Notably, miR-26a negatively regulates G 1 /S transition in different tumors and this has been attributed, at least in part, to the direct regulation of EZH2 by miR-26a. <ref type="bibr">16,17,19,21</ref> However, we showed that EZH2 is not a direct target of miR-26a in AML cells. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> Thus, we decided to investigate novel relevant targets for miR-26a function in AML. Between the putative targets of miR-26a, we noticed the E2F7 transcription factor (data from <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="adbb45e356-software-0">TargetScan</rs> (<rs corresp="#adbb45e356-software-0" resp="#annotator17" type="url">www.targetscan.org</rs>) and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="adbb45e356-software-1">Pictar</rs> (<rs corresp="#adbb45e356-software-1" resp="#curator" type="url">pictar.mdc-berlin.de</rs>)), an important regulator of the G 1 /S-phase transition. <ref type="bibr">23</ref> The 3'-untranslated region (3 0 -UTR) of E2F7 contained two highly conserved putative binding sites for miR-26a <ref type="figure">(Figure 1a)</ref>. To show the direct targeting of E2F7 by miR-26a, we constructed luciferase reporters containing the wild type (WT) 3 0 -UTR of E2F7 (WT), the E2F7 3 0 -UTR mutated at the miR-26a binding site I (Mut1), the E2F7 3 0 -UTR mutated at the miR-26a binding site II (Mut2) or the E2F7 3 0 -UTR mutated at both miR-26a binding sites (Mut1-2). Luciferase reporters were individually co-transfected in HeLa cells with a plasmid expressing miR-26a or control <ref type="figure">(Figure 1b)</ref>. The expression of WT reporter was significantly decreased by miR-26a compared with control. Reporter Mut1 behaved similarly to WT, while deletion of Mut2 partially relieved translational repression. On the other hand, expression of the reporter construct mutated at both miR-26a binding sites of E2F7 3 0 -UTR (Mut1-2) was not sensitive to miR-26a translational repression. This may be explained by the fact that the binding of miR-26a on site II increases the accessibility to site I or, alternatively, binding of one repressive complex on site II may serve as scaffold for attracting cofactors necessary for repression on site I. These results demonstrated that miR-26a regulated E2F7 expression through direct binding of the 3 0 -UTR. To further demonstrate that miR-26a represses E2F7 expression in AML, U937 cells were infected with a lentivirus containing an miR-26a expression cassette (Lenti-26a) or control (Mock inf.). Enforced expression by lentiviral transduction significantly increased miR-26a levels with a concomitant decrease in E2F7 protein levels <ref type="figure">(Figure 2a)</ref>. Similar results were obtained with the HL-60 cell line (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Altogether, these data indicated that E2F7 is a direct target of miR-26a in AML.</p>
        <p>RNA interference and miR-26a overexpression. E2F7 knockdown was obtained by Mission Lentiviral shRNA clones targeting E2F7 TRCN0000017455 and TRCN000017453 (Sigma-Aldrich). Mission Lentiviral Non-Targeting shRNA clone SHC002 (Sigma-Aldrich) was utilized as control.The miR-26a target E2F7 counteracts monocytic differentiation B Salvatori et al Lentiviral particles were prepared according to the manufacturer's specifications. Lentiviral vectors for miR-26a expression and control were described previously. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> Infection of AML cell lines was performed as described previously. <ref type="bibr">40</ref> Cell proliferation and differentiation. For cell cycle analysis, 2 &#194; 10 5 cells were resuspended in PBS/50% FCS, fixed in 70% ethanol for 24 h, incubated with 50 Ag/ml propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 U/ml DNase-free RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich), and analyzed after 3 h (10 000 events) using an Epics XL Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Morphology was evaluated after 7 days from lentiviral transduction in conventional light-field microscopy of Wright-Giemsa-stained cytospins.

Total RNA was prepared using Qiazol reagent and miRNAeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Hsa-miR-26a analysis by real-time PCR was performed using miRScript System (Qiagen) and E2F7 analysis was performed with QuantiTect Primer Assay QT00059115 (Qiagen). Delta-delta Ct values were normalized with those obtained from the amplification of the endogenous U6 snRNA (Qiagen). P-values between primary AML samples and monocytes data were obtained with t-test. cDNAs for p21, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 analysis were generated with miRScript RT Kit (Qiagen). Oligonucleotides are described in the primers list (shown below). M-CSF, M-CSFr and MafB were detected with TaqMan oligonucleotides Hs00166144_m1, Hs00234622_m1 and Hs00534343_s1, respectively, and normalized by the amplification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) Hs99999905_m1 (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies Italia, Monza MB, Italy). MiR-17 and miR-20a were detected with TaqMan microRNA assay TM-393 and TM-580 (Applied Biosystems), respectively. Delta-delta Ct values were normalized with those obtained from the amplification of the endogenous U6 snRNA, TaqMan probe TM-1093 (Applied Biosystems).

        <p>Data were weighted to represent the U.S. diabetic population ages 18-64 years.

We conducted two-tailed t tests and considered results significant when P was ,0.05.Insurance coverage was associated with both frequency of health care use and routine place to go for health care; uninsured persons less frequently than the insured visited a doctor or other health care professional (e.g., 12.2% of uninsured persons reported not visiting a doctor during the past 12 months compared with only 2.1% of insured falling into this category). In the second-less-frequent health care use category (one to three times per year), uninsured were still more likely to fall into this category than insured (38.6 vs. 27%, respectively); on the contrary, in the ADArecommended category (four or more times per year), uninsured were less likely to fall into this category than insured (49.3 vs. 70.9%). They were more likely to report no routine place to go for health care (10.4 vs. 1.7%, P , 0.001). Furthermore, frequency of health care use was associated with diabetes control <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. In general, diabetes control profile was improved as the number of health care visits increased. Those who did not report a health care visit had poorer diabetes control outcomes than those who reported health care visits four or more times in the past year: mean A1C 9.1 vs. 7.4%, P = 0.014; mean systolic blood pressure 127.6 vs. 126.2 mmHg, P = 0.56; mean diastolic blood pressure 79.6 vs. 72.4 mmHg, P = 0.002; and mean non-HDL cholesterol 171.3 vs. 146.6 mg/dL, P , 0.001, respectively.</p>

        <p>The economic benefit of a U-healthcare system must become clear if the system is to be widely accepted.

        <p>The model described above is calibrated to match the Spanish economy as closely as possible. We will shortly explain the calibration targets <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>, while leaving a more detailed description of the calibration procedures for ''Appendix 2''. Several parameters are taken from <ref type="bibr">Burriel et al. (2010)</ref>, who perform a full blown Bayesian estimation of their model with data from the Spanish economy. We assume the average lifetime of bankers to be equal to 24 quarters, resulting in a survival rate h of 0.9583. The maturity structure parameter q is calibrated to reflect the weighted average maturity of government bonds in Spain between 1998 and 2008, which is 6.1 years according to the OECD Stats database. The annual fixed real payment on long-term government bonds is set to 4.1 %, which is the 1998-2008 average of the interest rate on Spanish government bonds with a maturity of 10 years found in the Statistical Data Warehouse of the European Central Bank <ref type="bibr">(2014)</ref>.</p>
        <p>The ratio of investment, government consumption and government debt over GDP are derived from Eurostat (2014). The 15-year average percentage of GDP that can be ascribed to private investment and government consumption is taken between 1994 and 2008. This results in steady state ratios of 22.6 % for investments over GDP and 17.8 % for government consumption over GDP. For the steady state credit spread C, the difference between the loans to non-financial corporations (''Total'') and the deposit rate on ''Household deposits redeemable at notice, Total, New Business'' for the period between 2003 and 2007 is taken. Loan rates are not available before 2003. We end the sample at the end of 2007 to exclude data from the Great Recession. For the 2003-2007 period we arrive at an average annual credit spread in Spain of 188 basis points (annually), which amounts to a steady state quarterly spread of 47 basis points. We calibrate the diversion parameter for government bonds k b t to equal 0.5 times the diversion rate for private loans k k t in all periods, as in <ref type="bibr">Gertler and Karadi (2013)</ref>. To make sure that this value does not drive our results, we investigate the model response for different values of k b t =k k t &#188; k b = k k in the Online Appendix. We set the diversion rate for external bonds equal to zero, as these are assumed to be safe and liquid assets.</p>

I heuristically explain the econometric models we are using to them, and even if they have not had classes in statistics, they quickly understand the research that I am conducting. Within a short time, we are working together on empirical research projects. These students also mention our work to their friends, and I often link up with other bright students through these referrals.</p>

        <p>Orbitrap settings for the identification of phosphopeptides and relative phosphorylation state analysis After phosphopeptide enrichment, TiO 2 -peptide eluates were loaded on a 1D nano-flow LC-MS/MS system equipped with pre-column (Agilent, Zeesen, Germany). A monolithic column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) of 15 cm length and 0.1 mm internal diameter was coupled to an Orbitrap LTQ XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, Ulm, Germany). Peptides were eluted during a 50-min gradient from 5-100% (v/v) methanol/0.1% (v/v) FA with a controlled flow rate of 0.5 ll min &#192;1 . For precursor masses determinations, resolution and accuracy of the Orbitrap were set to 3000 ppm and 2 ppm, respectively. MS/MS measurements were performed on wideband mode. Spray voltage was set to 1.8 kV and temperature of the heated transfer capillary was set to 150&#176;C. Potential phosphopeptide candidates were evaluated using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator17" type="software" xml:id="e7ef12082b-software-2">MSQuant</rs> <rs corresp="#e7ef12082b-software-2" resp="#annotator17" type="version">1.4</rs> software. A post-translational modification (PTM) score for localization, which estimates the probability to find an actual phosphorylation site based on fragment ions <ref type="bibr">(Olsen et al., 2006)</ref>, is shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. For the relative quantification of phosphorylation levels, gel digests were directly analysed using the same settings as described for phosphopeptide identification.</p>
        <p>In the present work, MS analysis revealed that SuSy1 from the nodules of M. truncatula is also phosphorylated at Ser11, the same residue identified as phosphorylated in soybean and homologous to Ser15 in maize SuSy1 (VHS 11 LKER; spectra can be found in ProMEX database http://promex.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/home.shtml). In addition, the relative phosphorylation state of the protein was analysed and quantified by comparing peak areas of the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated tryptic peptides derived from the same analysis (see also 'Determination of phosphorylation stoichiometry', and the workflow diagram in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1)</ref>.</p>
        <p>This study has demonstrated for the first time the absolute quantification of three distinct M. truncatula SuSy isoforms in an independent tissue-specific manner. It is shown that, besides the nodule-enhanced SuSy1, two other protein isoforms are present in root nodules at quantifiable amounts. De novo sequencing allowed for the identification of a new peptide sequence, most probably driven from the second most abundant isoform SuSy2, which complements the existing sequence information based on transcript data. Absolute quantification of N metabolism enzymes was carried out, enabling the discrimination of different protein isoforms from a single analysis, even when those isoforms were present at very low amounts. Nodule SuSy1 was shown to be hyperphosphorylated at Ser11 in M. truncatula and novel phosphoproteins present in nodules were identified. All peptides found in this study can be viewed in the ProMEX spectral library <ref type="bibr">(Hummel et al., 2007)</ref>.</p>

        <p>The surgical protocol was the same for both groups, besides the type of the alignment guide for the distal femoral resection (extramedullary/intramedullary). In particular, all patients received epidural and spinal anesthesia and the preoperative and postoperative procedures and surgical techniques were identical. Patient-controlled analgesia was implemented postoperatively using a 100 mL mixture of 90 mL of 0.125% bupivacaine and 0.5 mg/10 mL fentanyl via an epidural catheter. All operations were performed by the same surgeon (first author) using a medial parapatellar approach introduced by Insall. The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) was removed and the same PCL-sacrificing prosthesis (Scorpio NRG, Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) was implanted in all knees. The patella was replaced, and the prosthetic components were cemented in all cases. Lateral release was not performed in all patients. Two markers indicating the center of the femoral head and the anterior margin of the greater trochanter were firmly attached to the patient's skin in the EM group prior to surgery so the surgeon could palpate the markers and identify the mechanical axis of the lower limb during surgery. A femoral cutting block was aligned along the coronal and axial axes using new surgical equipment <ref type="bibr">16)</ref> and the two markers. The distal femur was cut without placing a rod into the medullary canal <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. The angle between the anatomical axis and the mechanical axis of the femur in the IM group was measured using a PACS system on a preoperative anterioposterior long leg standing radiograph. An intramedullary alignment rod was inserted based on the preoperative measurements, and the distal femur was cut. The entrance hole for the alignment rod in the femoral medullary canal was sealed with bone fragments before inserting the implant. An extramedullary alignment guide was used in both groups for proximal tibial cutting. A drainage tube was placed in the intra-articular space. After wound closure, a compression dressing using gauze and a bandage was applied, and the tourniquet was deflated. Drainage was discontinued from immediately after surgery until 2 hours after tourniquet deflation. All drains were removed 24 hours after surgery. Blood transfusion was performed when hemoglobin was &lt;8 g/dL or when dyspnea, palpitation, dizziness, or abnormal vital signs were noted even if the hemoglobin was 8-10 g/dL. Rivaroxaban, an oral anticoagulant, was administered from immediately after the drain removal until the postoperative week 2 to prevent thromboembolic disorders. The anticoagulant was discontinued if hemarthrosis due to intra-articular bleeding was present or effusion from the surgical wound continued. Tests for thromboembolic disorders were not performed unless clinical symptoms appeared.

The prevalence of allogeneic transfusion, a categorical variable, was compared between the groups using Fisher's exact test. Additionally, the presence of other related symptoms were also investigated, including the duration of effusion, subcutaneous hematomas, hemarthrosis, hemorrhagic complications such as infections, painful leg swelling, acute chest pain, dyspnea, lower limb thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism.</p>

The PCR was performed with a GoTaq&#174; Green Master Mix PCR kit (Promega) in 20 &#956;L of total reaction mixture containing 1 &#956;L of the RT-reaction mixture and 0.5 &#956;L of each primer (forward and reverse, 15 &#956;M). The PCR primers sets and the thermocycling parameters used are listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. The PCR samples were analyzed electrophoretically on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.2 mg/mL ethidium bromide at 90 V for 1 h. The bands were visualized under UV light.

The treated cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 0.1 M EDTA, 0.1 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). The protein content of the whole cell lysate was measured with a Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Whole cell lysates were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). After blocking, the membranes were incubated first with mouse anti-ratIL-4 or mouse anti-rat IL-13 antibody (1:500) and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody.

The Western blot results were analyzed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a70a742b04-software-simple-6">SigmaGel</rs> software (Figs. 4B, 4C, 5B and 5C). The data showed that stimulating with the IgE-antigen complex increased IL-4, IL-13, and TNF-&#945; protein levels in RBL-2H3 cells, and that treatment with 250, 500, and 1,000 &#956;g/mL SCWE reduced IL-4 and IL-13 protein levels <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4A-C)</ref>. DSCWE at 500 and 1,000 &#956;g/mL also reduced IL-4 and IL-13 protein levels <ref type="figure">Fig. 5A-C)</ref>. The inhibitory effect of SCWE was slightly more potent than that of DSCWE (Figs. 4A-5C). Moreover, SCWE or DSCWE treatment (100, 250, 500, and 1,000 &#956;g/mL) led to a reduction in TNF-&#945; protein levels, compared with that of untreated IgEantigen complex-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells <ref type="figure">(Fig. 6A and 6B)</ref>.</p>

        <p>All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. The relationship between the main and secondary outcomes and the effect of the intervention were examined with generalied linear mixed models (GLMM), accounting for clustering of patients within physicians. ORs for follow-up versus baseline within the two groups were calculated, adjusting for covariates that differed between baseline and follow-up patient populations; thus, the covariates included in these adjusted analyses included race, and clinical diagnosis of hypertension or depression. GLMM was implemented by PROC GLIMMIX in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="af73d8ff40-software-simple-0">SAS</rs> and was adjusted for race, and clinical diagnosis of hypertension or depression. Thus, the group coefficient represented differences between the intervention and control groups at baseline; the time of coefficient represented changes in the control group over time, thus capturing temporal trends. Finally, the group-by-time interaction coefficient represented the difference-of-differences for over-time change in the intervention versus control group, and was a direct comparison of over-time change for the intervention versus the control group. A positive OR meant that the odds of a patient being in control increased more over time for the intervention versus control group.

        <p>The size distribution of exosome was measured using NanoSight LM10 coupled with a 405-nm laser (Malvern, Worcestershire, UK) and analysed by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f155b0f04c-software-1">Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis</rs> <rs corresp="#f155b0f04c-software-1" resp="#annotator2" type="version">2.3</rs> software (<rs corresp="#f155b0f04c-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Malvern</rs>, Worcestershire, UK). MSC-EV preparation was diluted to 2 mg/mL with 0.22 mm filtered PBS and loaded using the NanoSight syringe pump and script control system set at 100 arbitrary units as recommended by NanoSight. Three 30-second videos were recorded at an ambient temperature of 20&#193; 218C with a 10-second delay between recordings. The minimal expected particle size, minimum track length and blur setting were set to the automatic default setting. Camera shutter speed was fixed at 30.00 ms, camera gain at 500, and camera sensitivity and detection threshold at <ref type="bibr">10</ref>. The size and number of particles of the exosome was calculated as the average of 3 replicate recordings.</p>
        <p>Small RNA sequencing ST-EV was prepared from 200 mg MSC EV as described above using Trizol LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The extracted RNAs were quantitated using Quanti-TTM RiboGreen RNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). One mg RNA each from unfractionated MSC EV preparation and ST-EVs was used for library construction. The library for high-throughput sequencing was constructed using TruSeq Small RNA Library Prep Kit (Cat. #RS-200-0024) and applied to an Illumina High Seq 2000 sequencing system (Illumina, USA) for 101-nt single-end sequencing. The reads obtained were trimmed of their ligation adaptors and reads shorter than 18 nts were discarded. The remaining reads were mapped against a collection of human rRNA sequences to filter out ribosomal RNA-like reads. The unmapped reads were subsequently mapped to Reference genome hg19 from the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f155b0f04c-software-2">UCSC genome browser</rs> (<rs corresp="#f155b0f04c-software-2" resp="#curator" type="url">www.genome.ucsc.edu/</rs>). The <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f155b0f04c-software-simple-5">ENSEMBL</rs> gene annotation (GRCh37) was used to annotate the mapped reads based on its genomic location. For details of the analysis method, please refer to ''Supplementary Material and Method.'' Western blot hybridization Western blot hybridization was performed using standard protocols. Briefly, proteins were denatured, separated on 4&#193;12% polyacrylamide gels, electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with a primary antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies against the primary antibody. The primary antibodies used in this study were mouse anti-human CD9, CD81, ALIX, TSG101, CD59, b-ACTIN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) and EDA-containing FN1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). After incubating with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, the blot was then incubated with a chemiluminescent HRP substrate to detect bound primary antibody, and therefore the presence of the antigen.</p>
        <p>We have previously described the presence of CTB-EVs in our MSC EV preparation. These EVs were shown by pulse-chase experiments to be derived from endosomes and were therefore bona fide exosomes <ref type="bibr">(5)</ref>. In addition, CTB could be used to extract endosome-derived MSC EVs from an MSC-conditioned medium. These CTB-EVs carried exosome-associated proteins and had a flotation density of 1.09&#193;1.17 g/mL. In our extraction protocol, CTB effectively extracts at least 96% of CD81 in the conditioned medium <ref type="bibr">(5)</ref>. Here, we determine the proteome of these CTB-EVs and CTB-EV depleted MSC EV preparation by mass spectrometry as previously described (10). 1,806 proteins were detected in the CTB-bound fraction and 1,547 were present in the CTB-depleted fraction (Supplementary File 1). 987 proteins were found in both fractions, suggesting that these 987 proteins are likely proteins commonly found in most EVs. The observation that 819 and 560 proteins were detected only in either CTB-bound or -depleted fraction respectively indicated that CTB-EVs represent a distinct class of EVs and that there were possibly other EV types beside the CTB-bound EVs (Fig. <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">1a</ref>). The proteins in the CTB-bound fraction and CTB-depleted fraction were functionally clustered into biological process, molecular functions and pathways by the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f155b0f04c-software-100">Ingenuity Pathway Analysis</rs> platform (<rs corresp="#f155b0f04c-software-100" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Ingenuity Systems</rs>, Mountain View, CA). From the analysis of the CTB-bound fraction and CTB-depleted fraction, we respectively selected a set of 20 pathways that had the least likelihood of the clustered proteins being associated with a pathway due to random chance, that is, the lowest p value. There were many shared pathways in these 2 sets. There were also pathways that were unique to either the CTB-bound or depleted fractions (Fig. <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">1b</ref>).</p>
        <p>The MSC EV preparation described above was extracted with CTB to isolate the CTB-binding EVs as described below. The remaining EV preparation after CTB extraction was collected as CTB-depleted MSC EV. Proteins (250 mg) from each of the 2 fractions were analysed by LC-MS/MS. Briefly, the samples were reduced by DTT, alkylated with IAA, digested by trypsin and analysed with LC-MS/MS as described <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref>. For each sample, all MS/MS spectra of each of the 3 independent preparations were extracted by <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f155b0f04c-software-101">ProteomeDiscovere</rs> <rs corresp="#f155b0f04c-software-101" resp="#annotator2" type="version">1.4</rs> (<rs corresp="#f155b0f04c-software-101" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Thermo Scientific</rs>, Bremen, Germany) and combined into a single mascot generic file by a hand-written <rs resp="#curator" subtype="implicit" type="software" xml:id="f155b0f04c-software-simple-11">program</rs>.

The search parameters were a maximum of 2 missed cleavages using trypsin; fixed modification was carbamidomethylation of cysteine, and variable modifications were oxidation of methionine and deamidation of asparagine and glutamine. The mass tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.8 Da for peptide precursor and fragment ions, respectively. Protein identification was accepted as true positive if 2 different peptides were found to have scores greater than the homology or identity scores.</p>

With this approach it is possible to simulate an uncertainty that is always associated with projects. After the fuzzy model is constructed, it is necessary to tune it (to set up the inputs on known values, evaluate the results and to change the rules or weights, if necessary) when the model was built. If the fuzzy model is tuned, it is possible to use it in practice.

        <p>The quantification of the interaction between the Tao eta allele and knockdown of candidate genes was conducted in stage 9 egg chambers carrying asymmetric clones with respect to the anterior-posterior axis (see <ref type="figure">Fig. S4)</ref>. To assess the interaction, the apical-basal cell length of both Tao eta + RNAi and RNAi only (or wild-type control) cells was measured at the level of the nuclei using the confocal microscope (LSM 700) software or<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="bbf8603b9c-software-2">ImageJ</rs> (<rs corresp="#bbf8603b9c-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">National Institutes of Health</rs>). The apical-basal length proportion show no gross morphological defects in the PNS <ref type="bibr">(Silies and Kl&#228;mbt, 2010)</ref>. Thus, although Fas2 down-regulation is critical for epithelial and PNS morphogenesis, both tissues can compensate for the complete loss of the protein. We propose that Fas2 helps to stabilize a morphological state and allows development to proceed only after its timely controlled endocytosis. This mechanism guarantees the correct timing of morphogenesis and thereby helps to coordinate the development of different cell types and tissues. In the follicular epithelium, Fas2 might collaborate with the zonula adherens in counteracting the pressure from the growing germline cyst. As a result, the cuboidal cell shape is stabilized and premature, and uncontrolled stretching is prevented. Subsequently, Fas2 internalization overcomes this control mechanism, and epithelial morphogenesis proceeds.</p>

        <p>Search engines are an important way of obtaining information on the Internet. According to Alexa Traffic Rank, Google.com is the most popular web site in the United States as well as in the world, and in May 2011, it was the first web site to achieve one billion monthly unique visitors. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Many people use search engines as a starting point for navigating the Web, making search engines a crucial link in connecting content providers and users. This has spurred a sizable literature on search marketing that studies clicking behavior at search engines. To date, most of this literature has concentrated on the sponsored links that are typically displayed alongside organic links when consumers conduct searches.</p>
        <p>Existing studies of sponsored search are typically based on a modest number of search terms and the corresponding number of paid clicks received by a single retailer. Our research complements these studies by focusing on the organic clicks that 759 retail sites received from more than 12,000 search terms. There is considerable cross-sectional variation in our data: It includes Web-only retailers as well as traditional retailers and covers 15 different retail segments including apparel, electronics, and mass merchants. For each of these search terms, we observe which retail sites received organic clicks as well as the number of clicks. We also obtained data from the first five pages of search results on <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-0">Google</rs> and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-1">Bing</rs> for each search term, and this ultimately permits us to quantify the impact on organic clicks of a site's rank (position) in the search results. Our data also include several different measures of the accumulated brand equity of online retailers. These data allow us to determine whether consumers are more likely to click the link of a retailer who is perceived to operate a high-quality site (as a result of the retailer's current and past investments in advertising, the depth and breadth of offerings, secure payments, one-click purchases, returns policies, and so on). Ultimately, this permits us to quantify the benefits of SEO strategies that attempt to gain traffic by improving a retailer's rank in organic search results, versus gaining traffic by improving the quality and brand awareness of a site.</p>
        <p>1. Alexa Traffic Rank is calculated by combining a web site's average number of daily visitors and page views over the past month.</p>
        <p>The remainder of this section provides an overview of SEO and the related literature. Section 2 discusses our data and describes the econometric methodology underlying our analysis. Section 3 presents our empirical findings, whereas Section 4 provides robustness checks and some additional results. Finally, we conclude in Section 5 with some additional managerial implications of our findings for SEO. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> highlights the avenues that retailers have for gaining traffic through search engines. This screenshot shows the search results that appear following a search for "shoes online" using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-2">Google Search</rs>. In this particular example, three different types of links appear: top ads, side ads, and organic results. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The top ads (marked by the red box in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>), if any, are the highest listed search results and appear against a yellow background. For this particular search there are three top ads; the maximum number of top ads that may be displayed is four. The organic results (marked by the blue box) are listed below the top ads. Up to ten organic results can appear on a search result page. Finally, the side ads (purple box) appear on the right-hand side of the screen; <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-3">Google</rs> allows for up to eight side ads to be shown on a result page.</p>
        <p>One way retailers obtain traffic is through the paid links that appear in top or side ads. Unlike organic links, retailers can directly influence the position of ads, which are displayed and ranked according to the results of an auction that is run in real time. Retailers identify keywords they want to bid on and specify how much they are willing to spend. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-4">Google</rs> determines the ad rank using a site's maximum bid specified for the keyword and a quality score, which includes factors like click-through rates and relevance. Advertisers only pay when the link is clicked; the cost per click is equal to the minimum amount needed to get a specific position (generalized second-price auction mechanism). There is an extensive literature (discussed below) examining this avenue for obtaining clicks.</p>
        <p>A second way retailers obtain traffic through the search engine channel is through clicks on organic results, and this is the focus of our analysis. 4 A site's position in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-5">Google</rs>'s organic search results depends on the site's relevance to a given search term. The exact algorithm that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-6">Google</rs> uses to determine a site's ranking is proprietary; according to <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-7">Google</rs>, it depends on thousands of factors. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Although the goal of SEO is to optimize the organic traffic a retailer receives through product searches on search engines, the ultimate goal of retailers is presumably to maximize their profits. One of the initial steps in this optimization process is identifying the benefits and costs of different strategies for increasing traffic. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Our paper represents a first attempt to examine the benefits side of the ledger, and in particular, to quantify the drivers of retailers' organic clicks.</p>
        <p>Our main dataset is assembled using data from <rs corresp="#a59f265dca-software-3" resp="#curator" type="publisher">comScore</rs> <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-3">Search Planner</rs> and contains information on the number of organic clicks web sites received for search terms and phrases entered at main search engines (i.e., <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-10">Google</rs>, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-11">Bing</rs>, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-12">Yahoo</rs>, <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-13">AOL</rs>, and <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-14">ASK</rs>) during August 2012. <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-15">Search Planner</rs> uses the comScore panel, which contains all online browsing activity of around two million U.S. users. Because our goal is to analyze the drivers of organic traffic following product searches, we restrict our sample to only include web sites that are Internet retailers. For this we make use of Internet Retailer's Top 500 Guide, which contains a ranking of North America's 500 largest e-retailers based on annual Web sales. Although not all of these retailers appeared in the <rs corresp="#a59f265dca-software-30" resp="#curator" type="publisher">comScore</rs> <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-30">Search Planner</rs> database, some e-retailers (e.g., Amazon) operate multiple web sites (e.g., Amazon.com and Zappos.com), resulting in a total of 759 retail sites for which we have click-through data. For each of these 759 retailers, we used <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-18">Search Planner</rs> to identify all search terms that generated traffic from <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-19">Google</rs> to the retailer. There is some overlap in search terms: as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Onlineshoes.com as well as Zappos.com appear relatively high in the organic results for the term "shoes online," which means that for both retailers this term is part of the set of search terms that generated traffic from <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-20">Google</rs>. In total we end up with 12,184 distinct search terms that led users to the 759 online retailers. The third dataset we use contains all the links that appeared on the first five search results pages on <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-21">Google Search</rs> and <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-22">Bing Search</rs> for each of the 12,184 search phrases. We collected these data using a <rs resp="#curator" subtype="implicit" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-31">scraper</rs> written in <rs corresp="#a59f265dca-software-31" resp="#curator" type="language">Java</rs>; the data contain organic search results as well as paid links. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> Not all 759 online retailers are relevant for each of the search terms in our data. For instance, Best Buy is not relevant for individuals searching for shoes and is therefore 9. Aaker (1991) defines brand equity as "a set of brand assets and liabilities linked to a brand, its name and symbol, that add to or subtract from the value provided by a product or service to a firm and/or to that firm's customers." Brand equity is based on factors like brand loyalty, name awareness, and quality. See <ref type="bibr">Keller and Lehmann (2006)</ref> for a recent survey of the branding literature.</p>
        <p>Our measure of a retail site's brand equity is based on the methodology developed in <ref type="bibr">Baye et al. (2012)</ref> to overcome challenges in measuring the "prominence" of online retailers' names. These authors point out that the standard approach, which uses historical advertising data to measure accumulated brand equity and the strength of a firm's name, is not useful in the case of online retailers. Among other things, many online retailers are privately held and do not disclose advertising expenditures; the parent companies of publically traded online retailers do not typically report monthly advertising expenditures at the URL level. They further argue that the number of product searches on <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-25">Google</rs> (or <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-26">Bing</rs>) that include the retailer's name or URL in the search query-navigational searches, in industry parlance-is a useful measure of a retailer's brand equity. Intuitively, the inclusion of "Amazon" in a product search indicates the consumer recognizes the company and can recall its name. This may be the result of past advertising campaigns, recommendations from friends, knowledge of Amazon's pricing practices, product depth, return policies, and so on. And in contrast to advertising expenditures, it is possible to use data from comScore to measure the number of navigational searches Amazon received in a given month.</p>
        <p>For these reasons, we use navigational searches to measure a firm's brand equity. Navigational searches are essentially a shortcut for typing in the URL of a specific retailer and then searching its site. Thus, our measure of brand equity is the total number of organic clicks a particular retailer received in August 2012 from searchers who navigated 11. Indeed, Best Buy did not show up in at least the first 30 pages of search results on <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-27">Google</rs> for the search term "shoes online" (checked on February 26, 2013).</p>
        <p><rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-28">Google</rs> continuously updates its rankings of search results to generate the most relevant search results, which means that our rank variable will depend on past clicks. It is therefore likely that rank is correlated with the error term and thus endogenous. A similar effect may be at work for the ads variable: Ad positions are based on the outcome of a second-price auction that takes the relevance of the bidder with respect to the search term into account, again making it likely that ad positions are based on past clicking behavior on <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-29">Google</rs>.</p>
        <p>The standard approach in the literature on clicks at platforms (e.g., clicks at price comparison sites or sponsored clicks at search engines) is to assume that such positions are exogenous. Using the Wu-Hausman test for endogeneity, however, we reject the hypothesis that rank and ad positions are exogenous in our data ( p = 0.0023 and p = 0.0116, respectively). To account for the potential endogeneity of these variables, we use information about rank and ads on <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-30">Bing</rs> as instruments. These instruments are correlated with the endogenous regressors, but are unlikely to be correlated with the error term, because <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-31">Bing</rs>'s decisions on search result rankings and ad positions are not based on past clicks on <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-32">Google</rs>. Indeed, using the Sargan test for overidentifying restrictions, we cannot reject the hypothesis that these are valid instruments for rank and ad positions on <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-33">Google</rs> ( p = 0.3795).</p>
        <p>As we explained in Section 2.1, a retail site is included as an observation if it appears on the first five pages of the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-34">Google</rs> search result page for a specific search term, independent 15. Retail segment fixed effects control for systematic differences in clicks across, for example, mass merchants who may receive many clicks owing to product breadth effects and specialty retailers who receive fewer clicks. Although this specification assumes the marginal impact of brand equity and rank is identical across retail segments, we show in Section 4 that the results are similar when one excludes mass merchants such as Amazon and Walmart.</p>
        <p>16. The p-value for this test, which uses navigational searches on <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-35">Bing</rs> as an instrument, is p = 0.1692. of whether the retailer received organic clicks according to <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-36">Search Planner</rs>. Complicating matters, <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-37">Search Planner</rs> only reports the number of organic clicks if those clicks exceed a certain threshold, which means we do not know whether sites receiving zero organic clicks according to <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-38">Search Planner</rs> really received no click-throughs for the search term in question or whether they were censored. What makes our setting different from a standard censoring environment is that the selection rule depends on total clicks (including paid clicks) rather than just organic clicks. This means that a different probability mechanism generates both the zero clicks and the positive clicks, and this cannot be captured by a standard Tobit censoring model. For this reason, we estimate a Heckman-type selection model. As we argued in the previous subsection, endogeneity is likely to be important in our data, so we allow for endogenous explanatory variables. Estimation of the model consists of two stages. In the first stage we regress a dummy for having positive clicks on all exogenous variables (including instruments) z. Here, it is important to include at least one more instrument than is necessary for dealing with the endogeneity problem (otherwise identification is purely based on the parametric form of the inverse Mills ratio). This additional exclusion restriction should relate to the probability of observing positive organic clicks. Because this probability relates to the number of total clicks, we use additional variables in the selection equation that are important for getting paid clicks: We add dummies for whether a sponsored link was displayed on each of pages 2 through 5 in the <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a59f265dca-software-simple-39">Bing</rs> search results.

        <p>The mRNA expression levels of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) were determined by RT-PCR. Briefly, SK-N-SH cells were treated as mentioned above, and the total RNA of each group was extracted using TRIzol agent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two micrograms of total RNA was first reverse transcribed into cDNA, and then routine PCR was performed as previously described <ref type="bibr">(22)</ref>. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control and products were analyzed on 1% agarose gel. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="c9e881799f-software-0">ImageJ</rs> software (<rs corresp="#c9e881799f-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">NIH</rs>, Bethesda, MD, USA) was used to quantify the optical density value of each band. The sequences of specific primers (Sangon Biotech Inc., Shanghai, China) used for RT-PCR are listed in <ref type="table">Table I</ref>.</p>
        <p>Western blot analysis. Cells were collected at 24 h after exposure to H 2 O 2 . In order to detect the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax, SK-N-SH cells were washed with PBS and lysed using a lysis buffer for 30 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 10 min at 4&#730;C, and the supernatant was saved for the total protein determination. Protein concentrations were determined using a commercially available BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology). For western blot analysis, equivalent amounts of protein of each sample (20 &#181;g) were electrophoresed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). After the membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature, primary antibodies (in TBST-5% BSA) against Bcl-2 (1:2,000; 12789-1-AP) and Bax (1:5,000; 60267-1-Ig) (both from ProteinTech Group Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) were added and incubated overnight at 4&#730;C for determining signal transduction events. The membranes were rinsed three times with TBST and incubated with an appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,000; #04-15-06 and #04-18-06) (both from KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) for 1 h at 37&#730;C. An ECL kit (Millipore) was used to visualize membrane immunoreactivity.

        <p>Based on our former studies, we built two risk calculators in the training cohort (n = 1059) from 2006 to 2010. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> Risk calculator 1 (RC1) was built according to the rules of a logistic regression model based on age, result of DRE, PV, logPSA (logarithm of PSA), %fPSA, and TRUS result. Risk calculator 2 (RC2) was built according to the rules of a logistic regression model based on age, result of DRE, logPSA (logarithm of PSA), and %fPSA. The dichotomous variables (TRUS and DRE results) were considered as 1 for positive and 0 for negative in the risk calculators. Then, we evaluated the performances of PSA, PCPT risk calculator, and Huashan RC1 and RC2 for predicting PCa and high-grade PCa in the training cohort, the validation cohort and their subgroups (e.g., population with PSA ranging from 2.0 ng ml &#8722;1 to 20.0 ng ml &#8722;1 and population with PSA ranging from 2.0 ng ml &#8722;1 to 10.0 ng ml <ref type="bibr">&#8722;1</ref>). In the current study, the PCPT risk calculation was performed using the available formula. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> PSA was also used as a reference prediction tool in our analysis. The high-grade PCa was defined as PCa with a Gleason Score &#8805;8 according to the Chinese Urological Association (CUA) guideline. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> Evaluation of the PCPT risk calculator was excluded in high-grade PCa in the criteria for high-grade PCa in the CUA guidelines <ref type="bibr">12</ref> and EAU (European Association of Urology) guidelines. Since the epidemiological database was not well established in China, the risk factor of family history in PCPT risk calculator was ignored in the analysis. The baseline characteristics (age, prostate volume, logPSA, and %fPSA) between two cohorts were compared using t-test for continuous variables or Chi-squared test for categorical variables (DRE result, TRUS result, and PCa detection rate under 6-or 10-core). Z-test was performed to evaluate the differences among area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of the two risk calculators, PCPT risk calculator and PSA. Two-sided test with P = 0.05 was used.

        <p>Western blotting. Protein was extracted using conventional protocols (9 M urea, 4% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, 1% dithiothreitol, 0.5% carrier ampholytes and cocktail of protease inhibitors). Protein concentrations were determined using Pierce&#8482; BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) with bovine serum album as a standard. Subsequently, proteins were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels using standard sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis techniques and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked by 5% milk (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) for 1 h and probed with specific antibodies for 4&#730;C overnight. Mouse anti-COX-2 polyclonal antibodies (dilution, 1 &#181;g/ml; catalog no., 3362R-100; BioVision, Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA) were used, and mouse anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase monoclonal antibodies (dilution, 0.3 ng/&#181;l; catalog no., 60004-1-Ig; ProteinTech Group, Rosemont, IL, USA) were used as an internal reference.

        <p>Through analyses of the time-resolved intensity of the SMS spectra, hyperfine parameters, including hyperfine magnetic fields, containing structural and electronic information of the resonating nucleus can be derived. The high resolution (DE/E , 1*10 <ref type="bibr">27</ref>) of the SMS technique enables us to detect the AFM to PM phase transition of SrFe 2 As 2 at high pressures. The spectra were fitted using the <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d4fb7c673d-software-simple-0">CONUSS</rs> program <ref type="bibr">35</ref> to derive hyperfine parameters including hyperfine magnetic fields of the Fe ions.</p>
        <p>Angle-dispersive XRD measurements were performed on powder samples at the 16-IDB beamline of the APS, ANL. The powder samples were gently ground from the same batch of the 57 Fe-enriched single crystals used for SMS experiments and loaded into the same symmetric DAC using Ne pressure medium and ruby pressure calibrate. XRD measurements of the starting sample showed consistent lattice parameters to the single crystals. To avoid systematic errors, care was taken to ensure that experimental conditions between SMS and XRD experiments were consistent: the same cryostat with the same temperature thermocouples and membrane controller were used in both experiments. Two types of XRD experiments were conducted: decreasing temperatures at a constant pressure with an x-ray wavelength of 0.4072 &#197; ; increasing pressures at a constant temperature of 50 K or 13 K with an x-ray wavelength of 0.3737 &#197; . Diffraction patterns were collected by a MAR345 detector and processed using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator22" type="software" xml:id="d4fb7c673d-software-simple-1">FIT2D</rs> software.

All team members will individually read the data material and come together in an analysis seminar to discuss the main themes <ref type="bibr">40</ref> emerging from the data and which are most important to incorporate in the training programme content and methods. This total impression along with the systematic literature reviews will form the basis for the action planning phase where the training programmes will be designed. The analysis of the data material from the implementation and evaluation phases will also be analysed according to the systematic text condensation approach. This analysis is deductive and theory <ref type="bibr">40</ref> driven as it will apply predefined categories based on Alvarez et al's 37 theoretical framework IMTEE. Research quality in terms of transferability to other contexts is key in qualitative research. <ref type="bibr">38</ref> Generalisability in the sense of exact replication of results across studies is not the goal of action research inquiries. According to Susman and Evered, <ref type="bibr">32</ref> the basis of generalisation in action research is narrow, situational and bound by context. <ref type="bibr">32</ref> This is also true for our study; however action research encourages transferability of project outcomes to similar settings when appropriate. Depending on contextual similarity, it is possible to judge the relevance of findings from our study and whether they can be applied to another study setting. There is a potential conflict between our purposive sampling and transferability of results to other settings. This will be addressed by providing details of the context in which our research occurs in our publications. Also, we will collect data about our sample regarding for example, their experience with technology, age, gender and education, which we consider of relevance for other studies and populations. This information will also be provided in our publications and enable a better ability to evaluate if our results are transferable to other contextual settings. <ref type="bibr">38</ref></p>

        <p>The CGE model we describe in this section is the GTAP6inGAMS model developed by <ref type="bibr">Rutherford (2005)</ref>.</p>
        <p>14 The model has three economic agents: producers, representative consumers (private and public) and trading partners. The GTAP6inGAMS model is a traditional static Arrow-Debreu general equilibrium model in which the zero profit condition and market clearance define the equilibrium. The GTAP6inGAMS is a modified version of the GTAP model version 6 developed for <rs cert="0.8" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f2ceada032-software-simple-0">GAMS</rs> users. Most of the model specifications are the same as the GTAP model. The differences between the GTAP model and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f2ceada032-software-simple-1">GAMS</rs> version of the model are as follows. First, the GTAP model is based on a constant difference elasticity demand system, but the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f2ceada032-software-simple-2">GAMS</rs> model uses Cobb-Douglas preferences. Second, the GTAP model assumes that global capital is endogenously allocated by regional rates of return. However, for 12. They, however, propose to achieve the bigger trade blocs by utilizing ASEAN as the hub for the integration (e.g. the three sets of ASEAN+1 FTA), which is not desirable based on the empirical analysis in the present paper.</p>
        <p>13. An income terms of a trade measure, the purchasing power of exports in terms of imports (the ratio of the value of exports to the price of imports), can be a better measure of income or welfare effect of price changes in international trade, especially for developing countries, relative to the net barter terms of trade. See <ref type="bibr">Chacholiades (1990, pp. 136-7)</ref>. 14. The explanation of the CGE model used in this paper is derived from <ref type="bibr">Park (2006)</ref>. simplicity, the GTAP6inGAMS model exogenously fixes the global capital flows. The model described in the present paper uses a classification consisting of 7 sectors and 25 economies, as in <ref type="bibr">Park (2006)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> The model solution has been calibrated, with 2001 as the base year, using global trade, assistance and production data from the GTAP 6 Database. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> The model has been implemented using the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f2ceada032-software-simple-3">GAMS MPSGE</rs>. <ref type="bibr">17</ref> The GTAP6inGAMS model is adopted because the CGE model is in line with the commonly used GTAP model and the solver, <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="f2ceada032-software-simple-4">GAMS MPSGE</rs>, is simple and easy to handle.</p>
        <p>To quantitatively measure the impacts of the proposed East Asian RTAs on welfare, output production and trade flows for each of the participating countries, members as a whole, nonmembers and the world economy, we empirically designed and tested four scenarios. For each of the scenarios, both import tariffs and export taxes between members were eliminated, but the trade 15. The seven sectors are: agricultural products, food products, extractive industry, light manufacturing, heavy manufacturing, technology-intensive manufacturing, and services. The 27 economies are: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, the rest of Southeast Asia, China, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, India, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Russia, the USA, the European Free Trade Association, the Western European countries, and the rest of the world. 16. The GTAP 6 Database is a global database representing the world economy for a given reference year <ref type="bibr">(2001)</ref>. For more detailed information, see <ref type="bibr">Dimaranan (2006</ref>For the base solution of the model economy, we ran the CGE model without changing its initial condition and derived general equilibrium values for each of the economies in the model. Next, we reestimated the model under different scenarios and recalculated the equilibrium values for each case. Then, we compared the different equilibrium values with the initial base solution in terms of percentage deviation from the base to evaluate the experimental impacts of each scenario on each country.</p>
        <p>Table 2 provides a comparative summary of regional economic effects of the proposed East Asian RTAs by type of RTA. The aggregate effect of the currently effective AFTA had no significant negative effects on the discriminatory liberalization of the Northeast Asian neighbors, but produced significant enough positive gains to ASEAN members. However, if ASEAN members decide to pursue the ASEAN Hub scenario, which includes three sets of ASEAN+1 FTA, it could raise ASEAN's gains from free trade. ASEAN's welfare and GDP gains could be raised to more than three times that of the AFTA. The negative effects on excluded neighbors could be problematic, although the neighboring countries 18. The trade barriers include both tariff and non-tariff barriers. For import tariffs, trade-weighted ad valorem tariffs include tariff rate quotas and the ad valorem equivalents of specific tariffs. The export taxes cover ordinary export subsidies, export tax equivalents of Agreement on Textiles and Clothing quotas, price undertakings and voluntary export restraints. The protection rates in service sectors are assumed to be zero in the GTAP Database. For more detailed information, visit https:// www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/v6/v6_doco.asp. 19. As the referee indicated, the base year for existing RTA, such as the ASEAN-China FTA, should be 2004 or 2005 (right before the year into force in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). However, similar to other hypothetical scenarios in the present paper, the complete elimination of trade barriers between ASEAN and China are assumed and simulated. Of course, we acknowledge this data problem as a limitation.could increase their exports because of the income effect from the additional GDP gains of ASEAN, with the increase in bilateral trade volume between ASEAN and each of the three Northeast Asian countries. In terms of the negative effects that could be expected from AFTA or the ASEAN Hub scenario, the Northeast Asian neighbors might decide to form their own regional protection strategy against ASEAN by developing a ChinaJapan-Korea FTA. The trade warfare between the two regions could be harmful to the less-developed ASEAN economy and would enormously benefit the Northeast Asian countries, especially the smallest country, like Korea. However, this duplicating RTA competition might not be beneficial to the world economy. It will cause much lower welfare gains to the world economy than those with the existing AFTA and ASEAN Hub scenario.</p>

        <p>NTera2 cells (NT2) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured as directed. To induce differentiation, cells were treated with 10 M all-trans-Retinoic acid (Cat# R2625, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO) for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 7 days. RNA was isolated using the Aurum Total RNA Mini Kit which incorporates an on-column genomic DNA clearance step (Cat# 7326820, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), quantified with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA) and stored at &#8722;80 &#8226; C. ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-in Mixes (Cat# 4456739, Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA) were diluted and spiked into RNA samples which were then reverse transcribed using iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix as directed by the manufacturer (Cat# 1708849, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) to make stock cDNA samples which were stored at &#8722;20 &#8226; C. Stock cDNA samples were pre-amplified for 10-20 cycles using SsoAdvanced PreAmp Supermix as directed by the manufacturer (Cat# 1725160, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) diluted at least 5-fold and stored at &#8722;20 &#8226; C. PreAmp was performed with panels of assays which include PrimePCR PreAmp assays (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), assays culled from public databases, assays designed using online software tools and assays from published manuscripts (Supplemental <ref type="figure">Fig. 1)</ref>; primers were at a final concentration of 50 nM each. Target genes were quantified by qPCR using SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Cat# 1725270, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and CFX96 or CFX384 RealTime PCR Detection Systems (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) using 20 l or 10 l reaction volumes respectively. Genomic DNA contamination was assessed using the PrimePCR DNA Contamination Control (Cat# 10025352, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). As a no-PreAmp control, stock cDNA was used to quantify gene targets directly by standard qPCR using SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix. qPCR conditions were: 98 &#8226; C for 2 min; 40 cycles of (98 &#8226; C, 5 s; 60 &#8226; C, 30 s); melt curve analysis, 65-98 &#8226; C, 0.5 &#8226; C increments, 5 s hold. <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="c6a1d40a15-software-1">CFX Manager</rs> version <rs corresp="#c6a1d40a15-software-1" resp="#annotator2" type="version">3.1</rs> was used for qPCR analysis (<rs corresp="#c6a1d40a15-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Bio-Rad Laboratories</rs>, Hercules, CA).

        <p>the Cq value between the Mix 1 and Mix 2 samples was determined for each target and plotted against the average no PreAmp Cq value. Fold-change bias was calculated as the difference between the observed Cq and the theoretical Cq for each ERCC target. The theoretical Cq is 0, 0.585, 1.0 and 2.0 for the 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2 and 4:1 sub-pools, respectively.

We analyzed three different ranges of target abundance, average no PreAmp Cq value less than 30, between 30 and 32.5, and greater than 32.5. The limit of detection was estimated as 2-fold the 95% confidence interval. For example, if the fold-change 95% confidence interval for targets between 30 and 32.5 was calculated as 1.0Cq, then 2-fold this value is 2.0Cq, which represents a 4-fold change. Therefore, targets with a no PreAmp Cq value between 30 and 32.5 have a 4-fold change limit of detection.</p>

        <p>All measures were coded so as to be consistent such that higher values indicate more positive orientations toward e-cigarettes and the likelihood of their use. Descriptive analyses used appropriate measures of central tendency and dispersion. Cronbach's alpha was used to assess scale reliability. Tests for differences and associations were done so as to separate the effect of student status and smoking status due to their conflation. Factorial ANOVA was used to compare differences in means across student status and smoking status, with effect sizes calculated (h 2 ). Partial correlations (r and eta) controlling for smoking status were used to assess associations within student status and to compare associations across student status. Across-group comparisons of associations were tested using Fischer's r-to-z transformation. Data were weighted for comparison of student and non-student groups.

There was not a significant difference at P&lt;0.05 in the percentage of dual users (among the 144 current smokers, which might support a relaxed alpha in which case the rate is higher among non-students). Non-students were also significantly more approving of public smoking, had a greater intention to use electronic cigarettes, and reported greater information exposure on electronic cigarettes. There were no significant differences on the remaining items (public vaping, attitude, norms, and innovation). <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> reports the simultaneous effects of smoking status (ever versus never) and student status on the eight variables of interest, with allowance for interaction terms. Significant differences were found for each variable conditioned on smoking, with uniformly small-to-medium effect sizes. Student status showed no main effects. Two significantinteraction effects were found, however, as reported in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> and illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. A cross-over interaction was found for information exposure in which student ever smokers scored higher than nonstudent ever smokers and student never smokers scored lower than non-student never smokers (meaning, students who smoked had more exposure to information about e-cigarettes, but students who didn't smoke actually had less exposure to information about e-cigarettes than non-students). Also, student ever smokers scored higher on alternate tobacco use than did non-student ever smokers, while the never smokers were equivalent across student groups. A closer look revealed that hookah use was dominant. Among ever smokers, the hookah use score was significantly higher among students (1.97 versus 1.61, t(191)=3.1 P&lt;0.01), with 58.3% of the non-students having never tried hookah, compared to 27.4% of students (&#967; 2 (3)=23.5 P&lt;0.001). Further examination also shows a higher rate of vape/hookah dual use. Among the student ever smokers who vape some days or every day, 50% use hookah some days or every day. The rate among non-students is half that, 26.3% (&#967; 2 (4)=17.6 P&lt;0.01). <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> reports partial correlations among the eight variables of interest, controlling for smoking status. Separate correlations were run for students and non-students. The Fischer r-to-z transformation was used to test for differences between coefficients. No significant differences were found, thus the correlations can be interpreted as equivalent. Different sample sizes account for some of the borderline contrasts between the groups (approximately r=0.10 required for significance). Despite no contrasts between student and non-students, the correlation analysis does reveal some interesting results. The variables can be considered as five attitudinal and two behavioural measures (with intention in the latter with alternate tobacco use). Each of the attitude measures presents a significant association with both of the behavioural measures, with the exception of information with intention. Of note, attitude, norms, innovation, and information have medium-to-strong associations with the two key variables of interest: behavioural intention to use an electronic cigarette and acceptability of public vaping.</p>

        <p>Electrical test system. A PXI bus test system was constructed to provide high stable powers for the sensors and to precisely measure the collecting currents from pA to nA. The test system based on PXI bus was consisted of a 14-Slot Chassis (NI PXI-1044), a controller module (NI PXI-ExpressCard8360), five digital multimeter modules (NI PXI-4071), and three power modules (NI PXI-4132). The three power modules provided voltages needed for the electrodes <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1c)</ref>. Two of the power modules were connected in series to provide 0-150 V voltage for extracting electrodes of the sensors, and the other power module provided 0-100 V voltage for collecting electrodes. The digital multimeter modules with shielded cables are capable of acquiring the collecting currents from pA to nA for five sensors at the same time. All acquired data were recorded to a computer through a <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator4" type="software" xml:id="a584cb90a8-software-simple-0">LabVIEW</rs> program linked to MXI interface.</p>

        <p>Chemical structures were retrieved either from PubChem (https:// pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, accessed in March 2012) or ChemSpider (http:// www.chemspider.com/, accessed in March 2012) databases using chemical names. Chemicals were removed if their structures could not be found. Each dataset was carefully curated according to previously established guidelines <ref type="bibr">(Fourches et al., 2010)</ref>. Briefly, counterions were removed, whereas specific chemotypes such as aromatic and nitro groups were normalized using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-0">ChemAxon Standardizer</rs> (v.<rs corresp="#e0ab19a106-software-0" resp="#annotator26" type="version">5.3</rs>, <rs corresp="#e0ab19a106-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">ChemAxon</rs>, Budapest, Hungary,<rs corresp="#e0ab19a106-software-0" resp="#annotator26" type="url">http://www.chemaxon.com</rs>). The presence of duplicates, i.e., identical compounds reported more than once in the same dataset, is known to lead to over-optimistic estimations of the predictivity for developed QSAR models. However, the analysis of such records also gives an estimate of the dataset quality: if activity data for the same compound are consistent, the overall data quality is high; if there is a large deviation in experimental values between different records of the same compound, the quality is, obviously, low. Thus, after the structural standardization, the duplicates were identified using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-simple-4">ISIDA Duplicates</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Varnek et al., 2008)</ref> and <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-simple-5">HiT QSAR</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Kuz'min et al., 2008)</ref> software and carefully analyzed. If the experimental properties associated with two duplicative structures were identical, or highly similar, then one compound was chosen at random and deleted. However, if their experimental properties were significantly different, we deleted both records from the dataset. During the curation of human skin permeability dataset, we found 17 pairs of duplicate structures and two sets of triplicates as shown in <ref type="table">Table S</ref>3. The permeability values for duplicative records were almost identical (logKp variation ~ 0.01 LU) except those for butanoic acid that had a variation higher than ca. 0.4 LU. Thus, the LogKp value for all 17 compounds was averaged and the duplicative records were removed so that only one permeability coefficient was used for a chemical compound.</p>
        <p>Hierarchical Cluster Analysis-The clustering of a chemical dataset consists of merging compounds into distinct clusters of chemically similar molecules [see <ref type="bibr">(Downs and Barnard, 2003; Mercier, 2003)</ref> for a review of the most popular clustering approaches used in computational chemistry]. In this study, we have employed the Sequential Agglomerative Hierarchical Non-overlapping (SAHN) method implemented in the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-3">ISIDA/Cluster</rs> program (<rs corresp="#e0ab19a106-software-3" resp="#annotator26" type="url">http://infochim.u-strasbg.fr</rs>) <ref type="bibr">(Varnek et al., 2007)</ref>. Briefly, each compound represents one cluster at the start. Then, the m compounds are merged iteratively into clusters using their pairwise Euclidean distances stored in a squared (m * m) symmetric distance matrix. The two closest objects (molecules or clusters) are iteratively identified and merged to form a new cluster, the distance matrix being updated with the re-computed distances separating the newly formed cluster and the others, according to the user-specified type of linkage (complete linkage in this study). The process is repeated until one cluster remains. The parent-child relationships between clusters result in a hierarchical data representation, or dendrogram. In particular, we used <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-simple-8">ISIDA/Cluster</rs> to obtain the heat map (see Results section) of the proximity matrix.</p>
        <p>Dragon Descriptors-The following types of descriptors were generated using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-5">Dragon</rs> software (v.<rs corresp="#e0ab19a106-software-5" resp="#annotator26" type="version">5.5</rs>, <rs corresp="#e0ab19a106-software-5" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Talete SRL</rs>, Milan, Italy): 0D constitutional (atom and group counts), 1D functional groups, 1D atom-centered fragments, 2D topological descriptors, 2D walk and path counts, 2D autocorrelations, 2D connectivity indices, 2D information indices, 2D topological charge indices, 2D eigenvalue-based indices, 2D topological descriptors, 2D edge-adjacency indices, 2D Burden eigenvalues, 2D binary fingerprints, 2D frequency fingerprints, and molecular properties. The detailed discussion for these descriptors can be found elsewhere <ref type="bibr">(Todeschini and Consonni, 2000)</ref>.</p>
        <p>SiRMS Descriptors-2D Simplex Representation of Molecular Structure (SiRMS) descriptors <ref type="bibr">(Muratov et al., 2010)</ref> (representing numbers of unique tetratomic fragments with fixed composition and topological structure) were generated by the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-simple-12">HiT QSAR</rs> software <ref type="bibr">(Kuz'min et al., 2008)</ref>. At the 2D level, the connectivity of atoms in a simplex, atom type, and bond nature (single, double, triple, or aromatic) have been considered. SiRMS descriptors account not only for the atom type, but also for other atomic characteristics that may impact biological activity of molecules, e.g., partial charge, lipophilicity, refraction, and an atom ability for being a donor/acceptor in hydrogen-bond formation (H-bond). For atom characteristics with continuous values (charge, lipophilicity, and refraction) the division of the entire value range into definite discrete groups has been carried out. The atoms have been divided into four groups corresponding to their (i) partial charge A&#8804;&#8722;0.05&lt;B&#8804;0&lt;C&#8804;0.05&lt;D, (ii) lipophilicity A&#8804;&#8722;0.5&lt;B&#8804;0&lt;C&#8804;0.5&lt;D, and (iii) refraction A&#8804;1.5&lt;B&#8804;3&lt;C&#8804;8&lt;D. For H-bond characteristic, the atoms have been divided into three groups: A (acceptor of hydrogen in H-bond), D (donor of hydrogen in H-bond), and I (indifferent atom). The usage of sundry variants of differentiation of simplex vertexes (atoms) represents the principal feature of the SiRMS approach <ref type="bibr">(Kuz'min et al., 2007)</ref>. Detailed description of <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-simple-13">HiT QSAR</rs> and SiRMS can be found elsewhere <ref type="bibr">(Kuz'min et al., 2008; Muratov et al., 2010)</ref>.</p>
        <p>Random Forest-Random Forest models were constructed according to the original RF algorithm <ref type="bibr">(Breiman, 2001)</ref> using the <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-8">CF</rs> software version <rs corresp="#e0ab19a106-software-8" resp="#annotator26" type="version">2.12</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Polishchuk et al., 2009)</ref>. RF is an ensemble of single decision trees. Outputs of all trees are aggregated to obtain one final prediction. Each tree is grown as follows: (i) a bootstrap sample is produced from the whole set of N compounds to form a training set for the current tree. Compounds that are not in the training set of the current tree are placed in the out-of-bag (OOB) set (size of ~ N/3); (ii) the best split by CART algorithm <ref type="bibr">(Breiman et al., 1984)</ref> among the m randomly selected descriptors from the entire pool in each node is chosen; (iii) each tree is then grown to the largest possible extent; there is no pruning. The predicted classification values are defined by majority voting for one of the classes. Thus, each tree predicts values for only those compounds that are not included in the training set of that tree (for OOB set only). Since RF possesses its own reliable statistical characteristics (based on OOB set prediction) which could be used for validation and model selection, no cross-validation was performed <ref type="bibr">(Breiman, 2001)</ref>. Thus, the final model is chosen by the lowest error for prediction of the OOB set. The local (tree) applicability domain approach <ref type="bibr">(Artemenko et al., 2011)</ref> was used for all RF models developed in this study.</p>
        <p>where K o/w is the octanol/water partition coefficient and MW is the molecular weight of the chemical. Human skin permeability dataset (dataset D) was imported to <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-simple-16">DERMWIN</rs> as SMILES strings, and logKp was calculated and compared to the predictions of our models.</p>
        <p>The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-12">DERMWIN</rs> module available as part of the <rs corresp="#e0ab19a106-software-12" resp="#curator" type="publisher">EPI Suite</rs> software has been employed in several recent studies <ref type="bibr">(Fong and Tong, 2012; Fong et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2013)</ref> for evaluating skin permeability. For this reason, we decided to compare our models with that implemented in this software. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-simple-19">DERMWIN</rs> uses a linear equation that relates the permeability coefficient with the chemical's octanol/water partition coefficient and molecular weight. However, statistical characteristics of this model suggested that this correlation was not adequate to predict human permeability. Although our consensus model 12 had a lower coverage of chemical space than <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-simple-20">DERMWIN</rs> (77% vs. 100%), it significantly outperformed <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-simple-21">DERMWIN</rs> in predictivity (Q 2 ext = 72% vs. 43%, respectively) (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). When the AD restriction was removed and the predictive accuracy of the models was evaluated using the same set of compounds (143 compounds), the comparison was in favor of our model (Q 2 ext = 71% vs. 66%, respectively) (see <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>).</p>
        <p>We have built statistically significant and externally predictive QSAR models of skin permeability that can be used to predict the permeability of untested compounds through the skin. Comparison of the developed consensus model with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator26" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-simple-22">DERMWIN</rs> software showed that our model significantly outperformed <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-simple-23">DERMWIN</rs> in predictivity (Q 2 ext = 72% and 43%, respectively) but at the expense of some lost in coverage (77% vs. 100%); when applied to the same set of compounds as used for <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="e0ab19a106-software-simple-24">DERMWIN</rs> (ignoring the AD for our models) the performance of our model is still higher (Q 2 ext = 71% vs. 66%). The compiled datasets and all the models developed in this study have been made publicly available at the Chembench Web Portal (http://chembench.mml.unc.edu).</p>

        <p>Differences in age between healthy controls and patients were examined using twotailed Student's t test, and the 2 test was used to examine differences in gender distribution. For the case-control association study, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) testing of the SNPs was done using SNPAlyze V7.0 Pro (Dynacom, Chiba, Japan). The HWE tests were carried out for all loci in patients and controls. Differences in genotypic and allelic frequencies were evaluated based on the case-control design using 2 analysis. Linkage disequilibrium (LD), denoted as D ', was calculated from the haplotype frequency using the expectation-maximization algorithm. The LD block was also identified using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="a93bdc2ade-software-simple-0">SNPAlyse</rs> software when D ' was greater than 0.75. Case-control haplotype analysis was also performed using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator10" type="software" xml:id="a93bdc2ade-software-simple-1">SNPAlyse</rs> software. Permutation analysis was used to determine the empirical significance and to calculate the p values based on 10,000 replications. The global p values represent the overall significance using the 2 test when the observed versus expected frequencies of all haplotypes are considered together. Individual haplotypes were tested for association by grouping all other haplotypes together and applying the 2 test with 1 d.f. All p values reported are two-tailed. Statistical significance was defined at p ! 0.05.</p>
        <p>To analyze interactions between SNPs in PGBD1 and APOE genotypes, logistic regression analysis was performed using HealthSketch version 2.5 (Dynacom). The probability (P c ) of an individual being a case rather than a control is assumed to be affected by a set of SNPs, according to the logistic model. For example, logit(P) = b 0 + b 1 x 1 + b 2 x 2 for a single SNP. Here, we use a coding scheme x 1 = -1, 0, 1 and x 2 = -0.5, 0.5, -0.5 for genotypes homozygous for major alleles, heterozygous, and homozygous for minor alleles (for APOE , 4 was assumed to be the minor allele, and 2 and 3 were assumed to be major alleles simultaneously), respectively, to represent an additive effect with x 1 and a dominant/recessive effect with x 2 . The weights were estimated with the maximum likelihood method and tested by comparison with the null hypothesis logit(P c ) = b 0 (constant). We performed a stepwise forward selection procedure with two purposes: the first was to test the relationships among multiple SNPs in PGBD1 and the APOE genotype, and the second was to confirm the interaction among the SNPs if a significant association with p ! 0.05 was shown with individual logistic models. Multiple regression analyses were performed to estimate the relationship among the age of onset, APOE status, and the 4 SNPs using <rs resp="#curator" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="a93bdc2ade-software-2">SPSS</rs> software ver. <rs corresp="#a93bdc2ade-software-2" resp="#annotator10" type="version">17.0</rs> for Windows (<rs corresp="#a93bdc2ade-software-2" resp="#curator" type="publisher">IBM</rs>, Chicago, Ill., USA).</p>

        <p>We used single turnover kinetics experiments under saturating enzyme conditions ([E] &gt; [S] &gt;&gt; K d ) to obtain a rate constant (k max ) that is not influenced by product release or product inhibition. This is important because TDG exhibits very slow product release and strong product inhibition, which dominates k cat values determined using steady-state kinetics <ref type="bibr">(19,32,33)</ref>. Experiments were collected at room temperature (23 C) in HEMN.1 buffer (0.02 M HEPES, 0.2 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 M NaCl). Experiments were initiated by adding concentrated TDG to buffered substrate, followed by rapid mixing. At various time points, aliquots were removed, quenched with 50% (v:v) 0.3 M NaOH and 0.03 M EDTA, and heated at 85 C for 15 min to cleave the DNA backbone at enzyme-produced abasic sites.

The fitted parameters included dissociation constants for one or two binding sites on the DNA, and anisotropy values for free DNA (r D ) and for 1:1 and 2:1 complexes with TDG (r ED and r EED ). In many cases, the data clearly indicate two nonequivalent binding sites. Model discrimination was also informed by the probability value of the Fisher's F-statistic, obtained from data fitting, where P &lt; 0.05 is considered significant. The reported parameters are derived from global fitting of at least two independent binding experiments. We determined the equilibrium dissociation constant for TDG binding to unlabeled DNA using equilibrium competition anisotropy experiments, where TDG binding to TR-labeled 16U F 11 was monitored in the presence of varying concentrations of unlabeled DNA.<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="fe862776bc-software-simple-7">DynaFit</rs> was used for global fitting of the data to a model involving one or two TDG binding sites for the unlabeled DNA and two binding sites for TR-labeled 16U F 11. A benefit of using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator5" type="software" xml:id="fe862776bc-software-simple-8">DynaFit</rs> for the data presented here is that data fitting does not require an analytical equation, which could involve assumptions that are not compatible with experimental restraints. Indeed, the standard model for two nonequivalent binding sites assumes the species being monitored (DNA) is present at much lower concentration than the dissociation constant. This is not feasible for monitoring TDG binding to 16U F 11, because the minimal DNA concentration needed for sufficient sensitivity in the anisotropy experiment (0.5 nM) approximates the dissociation constant (K d1 = 0.6 nM, see below).</p>

        <p>A series of cryogenic experiments was performed at the Janus Laser Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a schematic of which is shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. A drive laser was focused onto a cryogenic target, launching a shock wave into liquid deuterium at an initial density r 0 &#188; 0.17 &#177; 0.004 g cm &#192; 3 . A second laser, incident on a Si 3 N 4 foil fixed to the target at an intensity of 1 &#194; 10 14 W cm &#192; 2 and wavelength of 527 nm, created an intense x-ray source by pumping the 2 keV Ly-a line in SiThe copper target is held at 19 K, liquefying the deuterium that is filled into the central cavity. A drive laser is incident on a 2-mm-diameter Al pusher, launching a shock wave along the axis. A probe laser irradiates a Si 3 N 4 foil, pumping the 2,005 eV Si Ly-a transition. X-rays scattered in the forward and backward directions are spectrally dispersed with highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) crystals whose direct view of the laser-plasma is prevented by Ni shields. (b) Cross section of the target reservoir across the thickness of the target. The target is sealed with aluminium on the front surface and a transparent quartz rear window to allow the VISAR beam to probe shock evolution. (c) Schematic of laser beam timing showing the shock drive beam (red) of 2-6 ns preceding a 2-ns probe pulse. The probe is delayed by 10-20 ns, depending on drive intensity, to allow the shock front to advance into the x-ray spectrometer view. Shorter delay times yielded higher shock pressures. (d) <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="b6efcb6856-software-simple-0">HYDRA</rs> simulations of mass density evolving as a function of space and time, with a lineout at the x-ray probe time of 20 ns. The compressed D 2 peak (r Shock &#188; 0.54 g cm &#192; 3 ) has traversed into the spectrometer field of view at t &#188; 20 ns when we make the x-ray measurement. The high-density peak lagging the D 2 shock front is due to the aluminium pusher, but is shielded by the x-ray window.These photons were collimated through a 400-mm-diameter aperture in the target, timed to probe the shock as it reached the x-ray collection ports. The x-rays were scattered from the shock front and collected through 400 mm ports at 45&#176;and 135&#176;from the incident photons. The probe pulse was delayed 10-20 ns after the rise of the drive beam, allowing the shock to traverse a distance of 350 mm to reach the volume accessed by the x-ray diagnostic port. The fields of view of the spectrometers were shielded with Ni-coated cones (40&#176;opening angle) from ambient x-ray emission and stray light from both laser beams. The radiation was collected and spectrally dispersed with highly ordered pyrolytic graphite crystal spectrometers <ref type="bibr">35</ref> curved at a 107-mm radius. The drive laser beam used a phase plate to produce a round 600-mm-diameter spot on target. The forward scattering measurements were made on deuterium shock-driven by a frequency-doubled 2-ns-long laser pulse producing a wavelength of 527 nm at the target. The backscattering measurements were made operating the same laser at the 1,054 nm fundamental. These shots used 4 ns drive pulses at moderate compression and 6 ns at higher compression, all at nominal intensities of 4 &#194; 10 13 W cm &#192; 2 .</p>
        <p>To determine the mass density-and hence compression r/r 0 -of the target using measured shock velocity, one of two approaches is necessary. Impedance matching techniques can be used to determine particle velocity in addition to shock velocity, closing the Rankine-Hugoniot relations <ref type="bibr">38-40</ref> and directly constraining state variables in the target. Alternatively, existing theoretical models or measured EOS values can be used to calculate compression from the shock velocity measured with VISAR; that is the approach used in this study. While one of several modern EOS models could be effectively used, we have chosen the quotidian EOS (ref. 41) because of its computational efficiency and the fact that it represents a middle ground between popular EOS models in the pressure regime of interest. Because we rely on an EOS that is not perfectly known, this approach requires careful accounting for that uncertainty in our inferred compression. Hicks et al. <ref type="bibr">42</ref> gave a comparison of both calculated and measured EOS values and their associated experimental uncertainties. For our experimental conditions, variations in EOS models are relatively small; near 15 GPa, where we observe the onset of ionization, models vary by about 10% in compression at a given pressure <ref type="figure">Supplementary Fig. 2</ref> and Supplementary Methods). This uncertainty is included in the error bar of quoted values of mass density. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> shows a VISAR streak record along with the extracted shock velocities for high-power laser drive conditions. Also shown are simulation results from <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="b6efcb6856-software-simple-1">HYDRA</rs>, a radiationhydrodynamics code widely used for modelling inertial confinement fusion and laser-plasma experiments <ref type="bibr">43</ref>. <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="b6efcb6856-software-simple-2">HYDRA</rs> accurately reproduces the measured late-time shock velocities when scattering is performed. Stray light from the drive beam is visible for 2 ns early in the streak. Shock breakout from the Al pusher into D 2 occurs near the end of the drive beam where a discontinuous fringe shift is visible. As the shock decays, a drop in signal amplitude is visible in the raw data, since reflectivity falls as shock pressure and ionization decrease. The peak velocity immediately following shock breakout from the pusher is 22 km s &#192; 1 with pressures near 50 GPa, which decays to 14 &#177; 1 km s &#192; 1 and 15 &#254; 3.5/ &#192; 4.5 GPa at 21 ns, the centre of the 2-ns-long x-ray probe.</p>
        <p>At the higher drive condition, a downshifted plasmon feature is visible centred at 1,998 eV below the probe energy of E 0 &#188; 2,005 eV. The plasmon resonance in this low-temperature regime experiences very little damping and is therefore quite narrow. The presented fit curves include broadening due to collisional effects calculated in the local-field-corrected Born-Mermin approximation, which goes beyond the random phase approximation to the dynamical structure factor by including electron-electron interactions and electron-ion collisions in the Born approximation <ref type="bibr">27,44</ref>. The spectrum is convolvedwith the instrument function introduced by the highly ordered pyrolytic graphite crystal and detector. The broad low-energy tail may be explained by bound-free transitions, whose fit includes density-and temperature-dependent continuum lowering. A best fit to the data indicates a delocalized electron density of n e &#188; 2.5 &#177; 0.4 &#194; 10 22 cm &#192; 3 due to the free-electron densitysensitive plasmon shift at 7 eV. Combined with the mass density inferred from the VISAR trace, this corresponds to an average ionization state of Z &#188; 0.15 &#177; 0.04. The measured electron density corresponds to a Fermi temperature of T F &#188; 3.1 eV. For typical temperatures of a fraction of an electron volt, the electrons are therefore strongly degenerate, with y&#188;kT=e F $ 0:1, and a scattering parameter of a &#188; 1.5. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows the 135&#176;backscattered spectrum from another shot using a 4-ns laser drive, and a probe beam delay of 15 ns. <rs cert="0.6" resp="#annotator3" type="software" xml:id="b6efcb6856-software-simple-3">HYDRA</rs> calculations using an intensity profile matched to the velocity measurements shown above predict pressures of 16 GPa and compressions of 3.2 &#254; 0.2/ &#192; 0.4, producing target conditions very close to those achieved in the plasmon scattering case. The ratio of elastic to inelastic scattering is strongly dependent on the ionization of the target; with increasing average ionization, the inelastic scattering contribution from free electrons grows relative to the remaining elastic signal. Fits are shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 5a for ionizations Z &#188; 0.1-0.5</ref> and a best fit is achieved for n e &#188; 2.4 &#194; 10 22 cm &#192; 3 . This corresponds Z &#188; 0.15&#177;0.08, in good agreement with the plasmon data. At these conditions, the scattering parameter is a &#188; 0.63.</p>

        <p>Finally, nobody appears to have made software code available. The conclusion must be that J-tests have rarely been used in empirical research up to now and that the main bottleneck for practitioners is the lack of freely downloadable software. Hence, besides further developing J-tests, and stating that J-tests are a useful tool to select the right spatial weights matrix and/or spatial econometric model specification, we suggest that the researchers who have been active in this field may have even more impact if they make their software available. This would follow LeSage <ref type="formula">(2015)</ref>, who has made available <rs corresp="#e99746b1fa-software-0" resp="#curator" subtype="implicit" type="software" xml:id="e99746b1fa-software-simple-0">code</rs> written in <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="e99746b1fa-software-0">Matlab</rs> relating to his Bayesian comparison approach.</p>

        <p>Cardiac output from a seated resting baseline estimated preservation of cardiac function. Impedance cardiography signals were recorded via a Hutcheson Impedance Cardiograph (Model HIC-3000, Bio-Impedance Technology, Chapel Hill, N.C., USA) using a tetrapolar band-electrode configuration. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded from the Hutcheson Impedance Cardiograph using disposable ECG electrodes. The basal thoracic impedance (Zo), the first derivative of the pulsatile impedance (dZ/dt) and the ECG waveforms were processed using specialized ensemble-averaging software (<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator16" type="software" xml:id="b7407431d1-software-0">COP</rs>, <rs corresp="#b7407431d1-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">BIT Inc</rs>., Chapel Hill, N.C., USA), which was used to derive stroke volume using the Kubicek equation. Following instrumentation, Impedance cardiographic signals were recorded for seven 40-second periods during a 10-min resting baseline. Finally, all cardiac output measurements were divided by body surface area, yielding cardiac index <ref type="table">( table 1 )</ref>.</p>

        <p>Gene Re-Annotation in the Neisseriaceae Family [Vol. 20, annotation. For example, Warren et al. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> uncovered 38 895 intergenic open reading frames (ORFs), readily identified as putative genes by similarity to currently annotated genes, from 1297 prokaryotic replicons based on across-genome alignment. New genes could be confirmed by the similarity alignment or by transcription or proteome analyses. In this work, we first used the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a2fe7a0373-software-1">ZCURVE</rs> <ref type="bibr">26</ref> program, which is freely available at <rs corresp="#a2fe7a0373-software-1" resp="#curator" type="url">http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/Zcurve_B</rs>/, to pick out all candidate genes that did not have same 5 0 terminals with all genes in the original annotation. The candidate may overlap one annotated gene with their sequences but they did not correspond to the same reading frame. Then those candidate new genes would be filtered by blast <ref type="bibr">27</ref> against the NCBI nr database. If one candidate met the following three conditions, it would be regarded as genuine genes: (i) it had the significant similarity (E-value , 10 220 , Coverage . 60% and Identity . 50%) with annotated genes in bacteria beyond the same genus in the database, and it had the similar length with the counterpart (difference , 20%); (ii) it had counterpart in the cluster of orthologous groups (COG) database, i.e. it could be assigned within an existed COG cluster; (iii) it did not overlap annotated genes with any bases or it had a smaller E-value and a higher identity score against functional genes in the other genomes in the case of overlapping. This process has been standardized in this work. For each of the 10 strains, all parameters in the whole process were fixed.</p>
        <p>During the process of genome re-annotation for the 10 Neisseriaceae strains, we found an interesting phenomenon. In a specific genome, two adjacent ORFs, which are predicted as genes by the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a2fe7a0373-software-simple-2">ZCURVE</rs> program, have the same function with known genes in the other species. The total length of the two ORFs just corresponds to that of the known counterparts or just a little different from them. Based on similarity scores, both of the two ORFs should be predicted as genes with the corresponding function. However, either of them is much shorter than the functional counterpart and could not constitute a homologue in the sense of length information. Perrodou et al. <ref type="bibr">43</ref> stated that unrecognized frameshifts, in-frame stop codons and sequencing errors often led to interrupted coding sequences. Very recently, Sharma et al. <ref type="bibr">44</ref> performed a pilot study on bacterial genes with disrupted ORFs. Their results indicated that many disrupted genes likely utilized the nonstandard decoding mechanisms: programmed ribosomal frameshifting and programmed transcriptional realignment. Given that our recognized adjacent ORFs have identical functions, they should originate from the disruption of a longer gene by a frameshift or an in-frame stop codon and rarely by the sequencing error. Numbers of disrupted ORFs are listed in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> and details of them are illustrated in <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S4</ref>. Totally, 111 disrupted ORFs (or partial genes) were identified in six strains of the genus Neisseria and two in L. hongkongensis.According to Sharma et al., <ref type="bibr">44</ref> some of the disrupted ORFs still encode proteins. Consistent with this, both of the disrupted ORFs LHK_A0007 (newly predicted) and LHK_02777 (originally annotated) are found to be transcribed in L. hongkongensis cells by the PCR experiment. Further wet experiment on functions of the other disrupted ORFs would be interesting.</p>
        <p>When annotating this genome, only one ab initio gene finder was used. <ref type="bibr">42</ref> Usually, two or more ab initio programmes are used in annotating the other bacterial genomes. Based on the very abnormal gene density of the strain, we suppose that there may still be non-coding ORFs, besides the 56 ones excluded by us. Besides the annotation method and sequencing time, some other factors also cause the different extent of errors. For example, genes in high G &#254; C bacterial genomes are shown to be difficultly predicted with high accuracy and this is caused by the fact that many long ORFs appear in this type of genomes. <ref type="bibr">32</ref> In addition, the genome could be difficultly predicted accurately if there are only distantly related species in the public databases. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> We should note that there still probably are noncoding ORFs and missed genes after the present updated annotation in the 10 Neisseriaceae strains. To assure reliable results, we picked up only those sequences with very higher similarities when identifying missed genes and we used the method with lower specificity when excluding non-coding ORFs. In addition, some thoroughly new genes, which have not significant similarities with any known genes, may be found by combing ab initio programme and wet experimental validation. However, the 106 newly found genes are those having similar counterparts based on latest databases. Also note that different detailed methods may be used to check the annotations of the other bacterial genomes, although the present systematic method has shown to be effective and reliable. For example, the recently developed ab initio gene finder <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a2fe7a0373-software-simple-3">Prodigal</rs>, <ref type="bibr">32</ref> which has lower false positives could replace or jointly used with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a2fe7a0373-software-6">ZCURVE</rs> <rs corresp="#a2fe7a0373-software-6" resp="#annotator8" type="version">1.0</rs>. Here, we used only the latter because the use of both of them generates basically consistent results (data not shown). The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="a2fe7a0373-software-simple-6">RPGM</rs> program, <ref type="bibr">39</ref> which is also based on the graphical representation of the DNA sequence, could be chosen as an alternative to eliminate non-coding ORFs.</p>

        <p>Interventions were placed into natural groupings decided before inspection of the results and agreed with clinical experts: 1. more supported (six or more contacts, or 6 or more weeks in duration), 2. less supported (fewer than six contacts or fewer than 6 weeks in duration). Meta-analyses were performed using a random effects model where studies were judged appropriately homogeneous. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic. All continuous data were presented using a mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and time to event outcomes were presented as hazard ratios (HRs) to account for varying lengths of follow-up. Follow-up time was converted to weeks. The results of the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) were multiplied by -1 so that positive differences equated to improved HRQoL.

        <p>DCE-MRI to determine Gadomer-17 microvascular clearance. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was performed to determine the clearance of macromolecular tracers. The MR contrast agent Gadomer-17 has a molecular weight of 17 kDa, but due to its dendrimeric structure, its Stokes radius is as for globular proteins of molecular weight 35 kDa <ref type="bibr">(Misselwitz et al. 2001)</ref>. The contrast agent was injected over 15 s during scanning through a catheter in the tail vein after acquisition of 30 baseline images. For the ANP study, 0.4 mmol Gadomer kg &#192;1 (diluted 1 : 4 in saline) was injected. In the rolipram study, 0.2 mmol Gadomer kg &#192;1 was injected. The MRI was performed using a horizontal bore 7T small animal MRI instrument (PharmaScan; Bruker Corporation, Ettlingen, Germany), equipped with dedicated mouse bed and head coil. DCE-MRI data were obtained with a T1-weighted FLASH sequence (Fast Low Angle Shot) with a flip angle of 25&#176;, repetition time and echo time of 13.77 and 2.52 ms respectively. A total of 600-1200 axial images through the masseter muscle were acquired with a sampling interval of 0.99 s, with a slice thickness of 1 mm, field of view of 2.5 cm and acquisition matrix of 96 9 96. A separate group of animals (n = 9) was used to determine the signal over time in large supplying vessels to the head to estimate the arterial input function (AIF). An oblique sagittal slice was positioned over the carotid arteries, and 1200 T 1 -weighted (same acquisition parameters as above) with a sampling interval of 0.99 s were acquired. The signal intensity over time was acquired in a region of interest of the internal masseter muscle using <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="be5b831f94-software-1">Nordic Image Control and Evaluation (nICE</rs>; <rs corresp="#be5b831f94-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Nordic Imaging Lab AS</rs>, Bergen, Norway).

Twotailed t-tests were used when comparing only two groups. When testing ANP-effects, one-tailed testing was used as extensive studies by others and us have failed to demonstrate any case when ANP decreases endothelial permeability. The Mann-Whitney twotailed U-test (http://elegans.som.vcu.edu/~leon/stats/ utest.html) was used to assess whether endothelial slit calibre or the magnitude of endothelial junctional complex differed significantly between samples from Wt and Epac1 &#192;/&#192; mice, as such data are not normally distributed. Values are generally given as mean AE SEM.</p>

        <p>The data collection effort is unprecedented in scope and size, and was carried out as part of the BPP. I first selected the retailers to be sampled by focusing on the top 20 companies by market shares in each country that sell both online and offline (" multi-channel"), and have product barcodes that can be matched across samples. Next, I used crowdsourcing platforms such as <rs corresp="#a5fd1edbe6-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Amazon</rs> <rs cert="0.5" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5fd1edbe6-software-1">Mechanical Turk</rs>, <rs cert="0.5" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5fd1edbe6-software-simple-2">Elance</rs>, and <rs cert="0.5" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5fd1edbe6-software-simple-3">UpWork</rs> to hire 323 workers to collect the offline data. Each worker was assigned a simple task: to scan the barcodes and collect prices for a random set of 10 to 50 products in any physical store of a given retailer. In some cases they had to return to the same store multiple times to scan the same set of products. Using a special app for android phones developed to simplify and standardize the data collection process, these workers scanned each product's barcode, manually entered the price, took a photo of the price tag, and sent all the information via e-mail to the BPP servers, where it was automatically processed and cleaned. A scraping software then used the barcode numbers to look for the same product in the website of each retailer, and collected the online price within a period of seven days. The matched online-offline dataset contains prices for more than 24,000 products and 38,000 observations sampled between December 2014 and March 2016.</p>
        <p>Collecting prices offline is normally an expensive and complicated process. NSOs rely on a large number of trained data collectors to do it correctly. Unfortunately, the micro data collected by NSOs for CPI purposes cannot be used for my comparisons because the retailer and product details are confidential information. Lacking the budget for a traditional data collection effort, I looked for alternatives using new technologies. In particular, I relied on popular crowdsourcing platforms, such as <rs corresp="#a5fd1edbe6-software-7" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Amazon</rs> <rs cert="0.5" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5fd1edbe6-software-7">Mechanical Turk</rs>, <rs cert="0.5" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5fd1edbe6-software-simple-6">Elance</rs>, and <rs cert="0.5" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5fd1edbe6-software-simple-7">UpWork</rs>, to find people willing to do simple data collection tasks. To minimize the chance of data-entry errors, I developed a custom mobile phone app that simplified the data collection process.</p>
        <p>The mobile app was custom-built to simplify and standardize the data collection process. It is an app for android phones called "<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator14" type="software" xml:id="a5fd1edbe6-software-simple-8">BPP @ MIT</rs>," available for download at the Google Play Store. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Every time a worker visits a store, she clicks on a button to open a new file. For the first product, she has to enter the store's name, zip code, and country. Then she scans the UPC barcode of the product (or the barcode on the price tag, depending on the particular retailer instructions provided), manually enters the price shown in the price tag next to the product (including all sales), marks the price as "regular" or "sale," and takes a photograph of the price tag (which is used to detect errors and validate the data). All products are scanned in a loop which makes the process quick and simple. When done, the worker taps an icon to e-mail the data to the BPP servers. A member of the BPP team verifies the submitted data and pays the worker. 5 I tried to conduct a similar large-scale offline data collection with MIT students in the Boston area in 2011, but most of them were asked to stop and leave the stores after some time. Collecting data this way appears to be easier now that more people use smartphones inside stores. Indeed, <ref type="bibr">Fitzgerald (2013)</ref> reports that the fear of showrooming has faded for many US retailers. See <ref type="bibr">Balakrishnan, Sundaresan, and Zhang (2013)</ref> for an economic analysis of showrooming practices.</p>
        <p>See <rs correspd="#10.1257%2Faer.20160542-software-8" resp="#annotator14" type="url">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mit.bpp</rs>. The <rs resp="#curator" subtype="implicit" type="software" xml:id="a5fd1edbe6-software-8">app</rs> can be downloaded for free, but a "project code" must be requested from the BPP team. This code is used to separate the data from different projects. See http://bpp.mit.edu/ offline-data-collection/ for more details.Notes: These retailers satisfy three conditions. First, they are in the list of top 20 retailers by market share in their respective countries according to Euromonitor International. Second, they sell both online through a country-specific website and offline through physical stores. Third, there is a way to perfectly match products online and offline for the price comparison. See the online Appendix for more detailed characteristics and results.</p>

        <p>Web-based forms for EDC such as those developed by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-0">REDCap</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Harris et al., 2009)</ref> are extremely useful for either clinician-or self-assessment, allowing the subjects to answer the questions on their own time in the comfort of their own home over the internet, and the answers can be collated without the introduction of an extra transcription step. However, self-assessment may not be an option in some situations. In the case of psychiatric assessments, Frontiers in Neuroinformatics www.frontiersin.org the clinician researcher often must be the person either summarizing or making their best judgment about the subject's response in order to complete an assessment, as in conducting the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis <ref type="bibr">(Spitzer et al., 1992)</ref> or reporting the level of consciousness in a neurological assessment of a nearcomatose patient, for example. Interviewers cannot maintain eye contact or a comfortable interaction when there is a computer monitor between them, which is problematic in various studies; having the clinician turn away to type into a web browser may be disruptive to assessing body language cues or the flow of the interview. Electronic data capture methods for research that occurs in a medical institution to integrate health records with research records <ref type="bibr">(El Fadly et al., 2011)</ref> can depend on internet access during data collection and integration. EDC methods are also needed for studies that need to be performed at locations without internet access, remote rural areas, prisons, or mental health facilities that do not provide computing resources and may even block internet access. These problems make traditional web and desktop software impractical for many studies, which in turn keeps these more distributed clinical studies tethered to paper forms. <rs corresp="#f75beef9fa-software-6" resp="#curator" type="publisher">REDCap</rs> is one of the few to address this, with a "<rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-6">REDCap Mobile</rs>" version which allows researchers in these situations to have encrypted laptops with a push-pull relationship to the centralized <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-3">REDCap</rs> database to allow data collection while off-line <ref type="bibr">(Borlawsky et al., 2011)</ref>.</p>
        <p>A list of current EDC packages are listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, with their published characteristics. Current web-based EDC solutions suffer from two primary disadvantages, as can be seen: The first is the need to have internet access in order to function, which makes them unusable in remote situations such as those noted above, with the exception of <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-4">REDCap</rs>. The second is that many of them are integrated into select data management systems. To use a specific EDC system one must also use a specific database and presumably port any pre-existing data into it. This is less attractive when the research group has a mature data management system in place for their neuroimaging data, and is looking to add EDC for clinical assessments.</p>
        <p>The solution is a system that combines the automated data capture of web-based self-assessment with the dynamics of a clinician's expertise and needs, and the abilities to work off-line until interface with an arbitrary database is needed. The <rs corresp="#f75beef9fa-software-7" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Mind Research Network (MRN)</rs> has developed a software tool for the real-time acquisition and validation of clinical assessments in remote environments: The <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-7">clinical assessment and remote administration tablet (CARAT)</rs>. We have developed this tool on a <rs corresp="#f75beef9fa-software-70" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Microsoft</rs> <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-70">Windows</rs> PC tablet system, and it has been used successfully to collect and administer clinical assessments in several large-scale studies. It has proven to be incredibly valuable in confirming that data collection across multiple research groups is performed similarly, quickly, and with accountability for incomplete datasets. Here we present its specifications and current availability, focusing on its use in conjunction with the Functional Biomedical Informatics Research Network (FBIRN) multi-site neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia, and the FBIRN Human Imaging Databases <ref type="bibr">(Keator et al., 2008)</ref>; and in conjunction with the MRN data management system <ref type="bibr">(Bockholt et al., 2010; Scott et al., 2011)</ref>, a centralized institutional level system managing multiple federated studies simultaneously. It has also been applied within an <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-71">OpenClinica</rs> <rs corresp="#f75beef9fa-software-71" resp="#curator" type="version">1</rs> data management system <ref type="bibr">(Bockholt et al., in preparation)</ref>.</p>
        <p>Linking to other databases. To ensure database platform and schema independence, this step is performed by a SOAP web service that is individually customized by a software engineer associated with the required database platform. This web service need be written only once per database schema and then applied to all studies that are stored using the same database schema. Modification for communication with FBIRN Human Imaging Database (FBIRN HID) 2 led to the addition of the ability to export assessments in different XML formats. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-11">CARAT</rs> can export the subject's data using the XML-based Clinical Experiment Data Exchange (XCEDE) schema, which the FBIRN HID uses to import data 3 .</p>
        <p>Real-time data validation. The validation steps can be set per question per assessment, and can be changed for different visits within a study if needed. They include checking required fields for completion, data type (e.g., numeric, character string, or date), bounds-checking (e.g., systolic blood pressure is a number between 0 and 300), and question dependencies (e.g., Question 2 "How many cigarets do you smoke a day?" does not need to be answered if the answer to Question 1 "Do you smoke?" is NO). <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-12">CARAT</rs> provides some complex controls like tree selects, and repeating groups of fields, as one might use for a medication or drug history. During an interview, the rater is notified immediately when a required field is skipped or data entered does not meet quality criteria, but the software does not require the rater to fix the data immediately. This allows the rater to complete the interview smoothly and fix data issues at a later time if necessary. CRFs that do not pass data quality validation may be stored on the rater's tablet and edited at any time, but they may not be submitted to the database until all issues are resolved. Examples are shown in <ref type="figure">Figures 4 and 6</ref>.</p>
        <p>In <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-13">CARAT</rs>, XML layout specifications for CRFs are created using a graphic tool that uses the SOAP web service to pull the question metadata from the study protocols already in the database. The layout tool is designed for raters or other study staff to use to create detailed layouts, including GUI elements and data validation, with a minimum of technical expertise. Questions may be dragged and dropped into a GUI form and then modified as necessary. If metadata about a particular CRF question does not exist in a database, the metadata can be provided directly in the layout(4) Conditional skipping of questions: Here, since the participant answered "Yes" about English being their primary language, the follow-up question is not required. (5) Required fields are marked with a red icon.</p>
        <p>The layout is then exported as an XML CRF specification to be included in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-14">CARAT</rs>.</p>
        <p>The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-15">CARAT</rs> software has spent the last almost 3 years in longterm piloting with multiple studies. During this time, it has been through three rounds of enhancement in response to user feedback. User needs led to extensive expansion of the options for assessment appearance, keyboard shortcuts for studies that made more use of the keyboard, expansion of user preferences so that default behavior better matches specific study needs, allowing sorting and re-ordering of assessments on the fly, creating missing data explanation fields, turning pen use on and off as needed, and various other usability changes.</p>
        <p>Navigation of lengthy CRFs on paper is often not linear; clinicians may skip back and forth as the flow of the interview require. To recreate this in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-16">CARAT</rs>, users may navigate through the CRF pages using the arrow buttons in the lower right-hand corner, or they may go to a specific page using the navigation tree.</p>
        <p>When Complete or Review buttons at the top of the form are clicked, the prototype validates all questions in the CRF and displays a list of errors for the user to address, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Clicking or tapping the error listing takes the user to the question that needs to be addressed. CRFs may be edited and saved with known errors, but they may not be submitted to the database until all errors are addressed. The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-17">CARAT</rs> interface includes the ability to create an exception, explaining how the data were not able to be collected, if this is the case. This method ensures that an error does not obstruct an interview, but that all issues are addressed before the data appears in the database.</p>
        <p>This prototype has been in long-term pilot with multiple groups, of which we will describe two examples: Psychopathy Research under Dr. Kent Kiehl located at the MRN and FBIRN <ref type="bibr">(Keator et al., 2008; Potkin et al., 2009)</ref>, a collaboration featuring more than 10 distributed sites. These groups use different database schemas and have different data collection needs. These projects have been instrumental in gathering user feedback as well as demonstrating the usefulness of the software in real assessment gathering conditions. We have recently added a self-assessment mode to allow the same <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-18">CARAT</rs> system to be used in computer labs for self-assessments.</p>
        <p>With the exception of the upload of completed CRFs to a database, all major functions on <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-19">CARAT</rs> are available without internet or network access. Asynchronous updates, however, can lead to duplicate or existing data in the centralized data management system, which must not be overwritten. <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-20">REDCap</rs> has developed an elegant system to manage these issues <ref type="bibr">(Borlawsky et al., 2011)</ref>;<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-21">CARAT</rs> handles those problems to some extent, though not as completely. At this point, the MICIS and BIRN web services will check against the subject ID, assessment, study, and visit to see if duplicate data already exists in the database. We are working to make the generic web service more flexible and secure for these issues while maintaining its agnostic approach to database schema Clinical assessment and remote administration tablet was designed and implemented on a <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-22">Windows</rs> system. Convertible tablets, for which <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-23">Windows</rs> was the dominant operating system, are being overwhelmed by the new popularity of slate tablets. Slates tend to run <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-24">Android</rs> or <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-25">iOS</rs>, as well as <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-26">Windows</rs>; <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-27">CARAT</rs> is being re-factored to be platform-independent, to take advantage of these new options.</p>
        <p>A challenge specific to multi-site studies is the need to have all users have the same implementation of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-28">CARAT</rs>, the same forms and layouts. For studies which decide on their protocol and never vary from it, it is not a challenge to set up one instantiation of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-29">CARAT</rs> and disseminate it to all the participating sites. Many clinical and research studies, however, find that they need new or revised CRFs over the course of a study; confirming all sites are using the same version has been a challenge for <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-30">CARAT</rs> in multi-site studies. Future versions of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-31">CARAT</rs> will implement automatic update detection, so that all sites are running with the latest version for a given study whenever they have internet access.</p>
        <p>Electronic data capture of the assessments and interviews associated with clinical neuroimaging studies have been used in many studies, and the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-32">CARAT</rs> system which we present has been tested in a wide range of study situations. The needs which EDC systems commonly address include using a web interface to transmit data directly into a database, usually over the internet so that only a browser is needed for the user. The ability to handle complex forms, multiple types of questions, conditional branching, and constraint checking is also needed for an adequate system <ref type="bibr">(Harris et al., 2009)</ref>. Unique needs for many research programs include the ability to use a tablet system rather than a desktop or laptop, and to work where the internet is not available, without giving up the ability to capture the data and transmit it directly to a study database. The demands of neuroimaging studies includes the ability to identify the subject's imaging data with their clinical and other data, preferably within a centralized multi-modal data repository.</p>
        <p>The first advantage of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-33">CARAT</rs> is that it was designed to work on a tablet, mimicking natural interviewing style. The use of the stylus on the tablet screen has been popular with researchers who prefer the pen and paper approach. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-34">CARAT</rs> also includes the ability to handle constraint checking and complex conditional branching, similar to what <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-35">REDCap</rs> provides. Data validation supports regular expressions, so error detection can become extremely detailed. Responses can be validated not just by data type (date, number, character string, etc.) but by complex ranges of these in almost any combination. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-36">CARAT</rs> at the moment does not implement the ability to reference multiple questions in a single validation rule, however; it can require the response field be filled in according to highly complex string-formation rules combining letters and numbers, but we can't say that the response must be less the answer to the previous question plus 100, for example. That has not been a common request from users, though it could be implemented if needed.</p>
        <p>An appropriate EDC solution must also provide a high degree of CRF customization to accommodate the almost constant stream of new assessments, and modifications to existing assessments, which comes with many research programs. The CRFs and other assessment forms must be extremely customizable, allowing for entry of common, rare, and unique study-specific assessments. It should be modifiable by the research team that is collecting and/or managing the data, rather than depending on the original software developers -ease of use in the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-37">CARAT</rs> layout system is currently a focus of ongoing development. Ideally, for non-copyright material, a repository of assessments should be available, built from studies already using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-38">CARAT</rs>, so that the forms for a new study can be set up quickly and re-use existing forms automatically whenever possible, similar to the system implemented in <ref type="bibr">(El Fadly et al., 2011)</ref>.</p>
        <p>Data-gathering software appropriate to the specific needs of clinical research interviews is unlikely to be widely adopted if it cannot conform to the data storage solutions already employed at mature research sites. It may or may not be possible to integrate data from independent software packages that employ their own distinct database schemas. The software must be able to plug into the existing frameworks already in use by mature research programs. It must have a mechanism to communicate with existing databases and schemas, be they off-the-shelf like <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-39">OpenClinica</rs> or custom solutions such as <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-40">REDCap</rs>. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-41">CARAT</rs> has the flexibility Frontiers in Neuroinformatics www.frontiersin.org to interact with arbitrary databases, rather than a single proprietary database specialized for clinical assessments, thus allowing the ability of combining clinical and imaging data within a single repository. <ref type="bibr">Franklin et al. (2011)</ref> reviewed several common EDC systems within their needs for small-scale clinical trials; their list of valued features overlapped with the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-42">CARAT</rs> specifications to some extent. Their list included availability of training materials, the presence of site and user roles and permissions, ease of designing CRFs including error detection, the ability to create a visit schedule for data-entry, and the ease in importing or exporting data in a standards-compliant way. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-43">CARAT</rs> provides training materials for the user interface, and the developers' manual for the web interface is in development. The fact that <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-44">CARAT</rs> is built to work with both MICIS and HID and to be expandable to other database system means many of the security issues and permissions are considered the purview of the database, however, rather than the data collection system. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-45">CARAT</rs> can validate that the rater's username and password is a valid rater for the study, and that the subject ID being used is for a subject who is enrolled in the study. Other levels of permission that are not related to collecting assessment data are not within the scope of <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-46">CARAT</rs> at this time.</p>
        <p>The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-47">CARAT</rs> software is available from www.nitric.org, under multiple licenses. For the research community with free re-use, it is available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). If the software is to be used with a commercial interest, other licenses can be negotiated.</p>
        <p>Internet-independence. <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator6" type="software" xml:id="f75beef9fa-software-simple-48">CARAT</rs> does not require an Internet or database connection for the entry of new clinical data. In the workflow shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, once the CRF information has been created during study setup, the data collection steps that follow, the subject interviews and data validation, data correction, and inclusion of any additional annotations, can be completed without any database connectivity. When network access is available, the submission process can be completed:</p>

        <p>There are also disadvantages associated with the RQ estimator. Probably the main problem is that only asymptotic of the estimators are known, which raises the issue of how parameters behave in finite samples. This may not be too problematic in our case since we have a large sample. Though estimating quantile regressions is computationally demanding, this problem was less so because of the availability of powerful computers and software programs such as <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator31" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="d8d0b10833-software-0">Stata</rs> <rs corresp="#d8d0b10833-software-0" resp="#annotator31" type="version">9.0</rs> which allow estimates to be performed relatively easily.</p>

        <p>Western blots were performed to analyze the levels of the receptors known to be involved in LTD induction. The DLS and NAc were visually identified in brain slices and were dissected with the help of a scalpel blade and tweezers. The tissue was frozen and stored at &#8722;20&#176;C until processed. The samples were sonicated in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and boiled for 10 minutes. Protein concentration was determined in each sample with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (BCA-kit, Pierce, Rockford, IL). Equal amounts of protein (30 &#956;g) were resuspended in sample buffer and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 10% running gel and transferred to an Immobilon-P (polyvinylidene difluoride) transfer membrane (Sigma-Aldrich). The membranes were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with 5% (wt/vol) dry milk in Tris Buffered Saline (TBS)-Tween20. Immunoblotting was carried out with antibodies against CB1 (Sigma-Aldrich, 1:500 dilution), mGluR1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, 1:500), mGluR5 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Waltham, MA, 1:500), GluN1 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., 1:500), and &#946;-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, 1:4000) in 5% dry milk dissolved in TBS-Tween 20. The membranes were washed 3 times with TBS-Tween20 and incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (H+L) (Thermo Scientific; G&#246;teborg, Sweden, 1:6000 dilution) for 1 hour at room temperature. At the end of the incubation, the membranes were washed 6 times with TBS-Tween 20 and immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA).

In addition to these covariates, BMI was included as a covariate in the model with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia as the outcomes. These covariates were included because of their clinical importance, our bivariate findings, and previous studies, which have shown that these variables confound the relationship between acculturation and CMR factors. <ref type="bibr">25</ref>,30 A 2-tailed alpha with P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

The quintile values of serum bilirubin in the 1, 208 subjects were 0.6 mg/dL, 0.8 mg/dL, 1.0 mg/dL, and 1.1 mg/dL and we grouped the subjects according to the highest quintile value of serum bilirubin 1.1 mg/dL. Differences in proportions among the subject groups were compared by the Pearson's chi-square test. Group differences for continuous variables were assessed by the Student t-test. We defined the event period as the duration from the date of the first health check-up to the date when subjects had become hypertensive during follow-up health check-up (s). We compared the cumulative incidence of hypertension between the bilirubin groups by Log-rank test. To determine whether the bilirubin category was associated independently with the incidence of hypertension, we used Cox's proportional hazard model adjusted for serum albumin and univariate risk factors for the development of hypertension. We checked the violation of the proportional hazard assumption by partial residual plot against time for each covariate and log minus log plots (LML) for categorical covariates, such as bilirubin group.

The obtained homogenate was disrupted by sonication, incubated for 30 min on ice with repeated vortexing, and then centrifuged at 15,000 &#215; g for 15 min. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was used for Western blot analysis. For the preparation of subcellular protein fractions, the cell pellet was homogenized in H-buffer lacking Triton X-100, and incubated 30 min on ice. Samples were then spun at 100,000 &#215; g for 30 min at 4&#176;C. The supernatant was saved as cytosolic fraction, and the remaining pellet was suspended in H-buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated for 30 min on ice. At the end, the samples were spun at 100,000 &#215; g for 30 min at 4&#176;C, and the remaining supernatant was saved as the particulate fraction. An equal amount of protein from each sample was loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher &amp; Schuell, Dassel, Germany).

        <p>The obtained viral genomic DNA was amplified using a GenomePhi kit (GE Healthcare) and used to make barcoded (10 bp) fragment libraries for 454 sequencing on a Genome Sequencer FLX Titanium (Roche/454 Life Science). The reads were assembled using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="cb3c123bbe-software-15">gsAssembler</rs> (<rs corresp="#cb3c123bbe-software-15" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Roche/454 Life Science</rs>). The coverage of the different genomes was 17&#194; for HRPV-2, 14&#194; for HRPV-3, 300&#194; for HRPV-6 and 300&#194; for HGPV-1. The obtained assembly was verified with PCR products that for HRPV-2, HRPV-3 and HGPV-1 covered the whole genome. The final genome sequences were obtained by sequencing these PCR products. For HRPV-6, several Sanger sequencing runs confirmed the initial assembly. The primers used for PCR and sequencing are listed in Supplementary Table S2. For the verification of the discontinuous regions, genomic DNA was used in sequencing reactions with primers, which are also listed in Supplementary Table S2. All sequencing reactions were carried out by using BigDye Termination Chemistry v. 3.1 and analysed on an ABI 3130 (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing reactions were purified with CleanSeq (Agencourt) using a Beckman NX p robot (Beckman Coulter). Sequences were assembled and edited using GAP4. The sequences were submitted to GenBank and can be found under the accession numbers JN882264 (HRPV-2), JN882265 (HRPV-3), JN882266 (HRPV-6) and JN882267 (HGPV-1).</p>

        <p>The first protein encoded by a conserved cluster of genes is VP3-like protein <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>). It is a major structural protein of haloarchaeal pleomorphic viruses, predicted to contain several transmembrane regions. VP3-like proteins of the first subgroup of viruses and putative proviruses share extensive identity at the amino acid level ($50% and above, <ref type="figure">Supplementary Figure S3</ref>). In contrast, VP3-like proteins of the second subgroup show only $20% identity to each other and to homologues of the first subgroup members. The next protein encoded in the conserved cluster of genes is VP4-like major structural protein <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>), forming the spike structure on the virion surface. This protein is processed during maturation. In order to predict the translation start site, the empirically determined N-termini <ref type="table">(Table 1</ref>) together with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="cb3c123bbe-software-simple-31">Signal P</rs> and<rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator7" type="software" xml:id="cb3c123bbe-software-simple-32">Tat find</rs> programs were used. Three of the manually annotated VP4-like protein precursors were predicted to have a twin-arginine signal sequence suggesting export of the protein in a folded state. Most of the VP4-like protein precursors share only $20% identity <ref type="table">(Supplementary Table S</ref> <ref type="bibr">8)</ref>. Even though VP4-like polypeptides are much more diverse than VP3-like proteins, the secondary structures are predicted to be similar. All of them are also predicted to contain a coiled-coil region in the C-terminus of the protein just preceding the transmembrane domain that serves as a membrane anchor.</p>

The patients were divided into two groups according to the CRP measured preoperatively: those with CRP values in the normal range (#10 mg/L) and those with elevated CRP levels (.10 mg/L). The Pearson Chi-squared test was used to determine the significance of differences between the two groups. The overall cumulative probability of survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the difference was assessed by the log-rank test. A univariate analysis was used to examine the association between various prognostic predictors and survival. Possible prognostic factors associated with overall survival were considered in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (Enter). Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to quantify the strength of the association between predictors and survival. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p>

        <p>Since D(1) is the lower triangular, the long-run multipliers from Aot, AYt, Art7, and it -n to Aht are zero, so the coefficients of their lags each sum to zero. Imposing these constraints yieldsThe variables considered in our model are total hours worked (ht), output (yt), inflation (rr,), the nominal interest rate (it), and real oil prices (or). The Appendix gives the details of the sources of the data. Estimates reported in this paper are based on quarterly U.S. data from 1951:1. Data before 1951 are used as initial conditions in autoregressions. The end of the sample period is discussed below. The data for labor hours, output, and price are for the nonfarm private economy, excluding housing. We choose output for the nonfarm, non-housing private sector, rather than the whole economy because there are serious conceptual difficulties in relating the output to the inputs of housing, government, and farms. Housing and government are imputed in the national accounts. Farmers are largely 12. In the <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="bb53f0a4b5-software-simple-0">RATS</rs> packages, the equations can be estimated without including the disturbances and then transformed via the standard Cholesky decomposition. This decomposition picks out a different linear combination of the aggregate demand shocks, but since only their joint effect is identified, this difference is inessential. 13. <ref type="bibr">Blanchard and Quah (1988)</ref> use a different technique to estimate models subject to these long-run Wold causal orderings. They estimate the unrestricted vector autoregression for X, and then transform the system by post-multiplying the VAR by a matrix that imposes the necessary restrictions on the long-run multipliers and the residual covariance matrix.</p>

The P values are two-sided. Although <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows comparisons of baseline characteristics between the 74 progressors (76% of all progressors in the oral insulin trial) who had at least one FPIR measurement after the baseline measurement (those included in the analyses below) and 270 nonprogressors (those not diagnosed during follow-up). Aside from the younger age of the progressors (P = 0.003), there were initially no significant differences in FPIR, log BMI, and sex. However, because the FPIR was associated with both age (r = 0.17, P = 0.001) and log BMI (r = 0.38, P , 0.001), we compared the FPIR between the progressors and the nonprogressors after adjusting for those variables. The baseline FPIR was significantly lower in the progressors (P , 0.020) with the adjustments. Additionally, with adjustments for age and sex, the BMI was significantly higher in the progressors (P = 0.035). The median duration of follow-up for the oral insulin trial participants was 4.3 years. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows FPIR values of the 26 progressors according to the time before diagnosis along with the percent change in the FPIR (per year) from the preceding FPIR. (Data are presented in the table and below according to the mean time from diagnosis of the FPIR measurements within each yearlong interval.) There was a small decline in the FPIR from baseline until 1.5 years before diagnosis, with no evidence of acceleration. The decline then accelerated from 1.5 years before diagnosis to 0.5 years before diagnosis. The median (25th, 75th percentile) percent change in FPIR from 2.5 to 1.5 years before diagnosis was 24.1% (229.8%, 30.2%, not significant), whereas the median percent change from 1.5 to 0.5 years before diagnosis was 229.3% (256.4%, -3.5%, P 5 0.001). Of the 26 progressors, the FPIR declined in 21 from 1.5 to 0.5 years before diagnosis and in 14 from 2.5 to 1.5 years before diagnosis. Compared with the change from 2.5 to 1.5 years before diagnosis, there was a decline (vs. a prior increase) or a more marked decline from 1.5 to 0.5 years before diagnosis in 16. The median overall percent change from the baseline FPIR to the last FPIR was 247.7% (258.2%, -27.7%, P , 0.001).</p>

Descriptive statistics such as, frequency tables and percentages were conducted to explore the general features of the data. The outcome variable (dependent) was the dental knowledge and attitude of HCPs who advised preventive dental measures. Preventive dental measures consisted of counseling parents regarding oral hygiene, recommending that parents seek dental checkups, visual examinations of the oral cavity and teeth to explore for causes of dental decay, age of first dental visit, number of tooth brushing per day, tolls of toothbrushing, persons responsible regarding the child's oral hygiene, sources of dental knowledge, and the main cause of dental decay. The independent (determinant) variables were age, gender, education level, type of job, and specialties. Chi-square test and logistic regression were used to determine significance of variation, or the association at a 95% confidence level (p&lt;0.05). A cross tabulation analysis was conducted to analyze different categorical variables (responses of the participants).</p>

        <p>Steady-state rates of ATP hydrolysis were measured using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) assays. Reactions at 37 C contained 30 mM MES (pH 6.2), 6 mM MgCl 2 , 30 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT and 0.1 mg/ml BSA in a final volume of 50 ml. The monovalent salt concentration was increased to 80 mM in certain reactions by the addition of 50 mM NaCl. In addition the reaction mixtures contained 2.0 mM wild-type or mutant Rad51 protein and 12 mM uX174 ssDNA. Reactions were initiated by the addition of a-[ 32 P]-ATP to a final concentration of 3 mM (10 mCi/ml final specific activity). Aliquots (8 ml) were removed at various time points and quenched with 8 mM EDTA and 1% SDS (final concentrations). Quenched samples were spotted out at 1 ml volume onto PEI-cellulose TLC plates (20 &#194; 20 cm) at 1-cm intervals. After all the samples were spotted and dried the TLC plates were developed with 0.75 M KH 2 PO 4 and allowed to air dry. The TLC plates were exposed for 1.5 h to a K-screen (Kodak) and scanned by a Bio-Rad Personal Molecular Imager-FX.

        <p>All participants were instructed not to exercise excessively and to refrain from caffeinated beverages, alcoholic beverages, and smoking for 3 hours before the psychophysiological measurements were collected. A lead II electrocardiogram (ECG) was collected for 5 minutes at baseline using the ProComp Infiniti TM system (Thought Technology Ltd., Montreal, Canada), which was installed on a laptop. A sampling rate of 2,048/second was set in order to acquire real-time interbeat intervals. The physiological signals were collected between 9:00 to 12:00 a.m. and 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. to minimize any effects of biological circadian variations. The CardiacPro Infiniti HRV analysis module (Thought Technology Ltd.) with fast Fourier transformation was used to transform the interbeat intervals into the various frequency domains of the HRV indices, namely LF power (0.04-0.15 Hz), HF power (0.15-0.4 Hz), and the LF/HF ratio. The time domain of the HRV index of the SDNN was also obtained.</p>
        <p>The demographic data and information related to heroin use, including the history of substance use, the age of onset of heroin use, and the number of times the participants had tried previously to quit heroin use, were collected among heroin users.

Operating conditions of the laser were: 8 Hz frequency, 100 mJ energy, 35 or 60 mm spot size. CaO contents determined by microprobe in the area of subsequent ablation with the laser were used for internal standardization by reference to an SRM612 NIST external standard. Raw data were reduced off-line using the <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" type="software" xml:id="e363439274-software-simple-0">LAMTRACE</rs> software <ref type="bibr">55-57</ref>., the projected vapour1liquid coexistence surface for salinities of 10 wt.% and 30-45 wt.% NaCl (green, extrapolated above 1000uC) and the vapour1liquid1halite coexistence curve (blue) from <ref type="bibr">59</ref> (V5vapour, L5liquid, H5halite, F5single-phase fluid). The orange path 1 represents a hypothetical fluid-unsaturated (e.g., H 2 O52.5 wt.%) basaltic andesite/ andesite magma that ascends rapidly to shallow level until it becomes fluidsaturated upon hitting the 2.5 wt.% H 2 O boundary. This magma will exsolve a fluid below the vapour1liquid coexistence line and will not have significantly high Sr/Y because it will not fractionate amphibole. If the same magma undergoes isobaric crystallization at P. ,0.2 GPa (red paths 2) it will eventually become fluid-saturated in the single-phase fluid field, above the vapour1liquid coexistence line. Because amphibole always precedes plagioclase crystallization above the vapour1liquid coexistence line in andesitic magmas and almost at any pressure above the V1L coexistence line for basaltic andesite magmas (except a small gap between ,0.19 and ,0.22 GPa), it follows that development of high Sr/Y signatures and exsolution of fluids in the single phase field are intimately bound together. Hydrous andesitic magmas rising rapidly to shallow levels have magnetite close to the liquidus (orange path 1), which might cause sulphide saturation before fluid exsolution, depending on the initial water content of the magma. In contrast, andesitic magmas evolving at P.0.2 GPa and thus acquiring high Sr/Y signatures (red paths 2) will crystallize magnetite late thus making possible the partitioning of Cu into an exsolved fluid before magnetite-induced sulphide saturation incorporates magmatic Cu.</p>

        <p>BlastP algorithm was used to predict sequence homologs of ScoRsrA from NCBI nr database (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih .gov/blast/db/). Multiple sequence alignment and generation of phylogenetic tree were done by using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b33a87b577-software-simple-0">MEGA4</rs> software <ref type="bibr">(31)</ref>. A probable structure of ScoRsrA was created based on the determined structure of R. sphaeroides ChrR (3; PDB ID:2Z2S) by using<rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b33a87b577-software-simple-1">Modeller</rs> program <ref type="bibr">(32)</ref>, and was visualized through <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b33a87b577-software-simple-2">PyMOL</rs> <ref type="bibr">(33)</ref>. Sequence logos were generated by using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b33a87b577-software-simple-3">TEXshade</rs> <ref type="bibr">(34,35)</ref>.</p>
        <p>We constructed a phylogenetic tree using a neighborjoining algorithm provided by <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b33a87b577-software-simple-4">MEGA4</rs> program <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Four reported redox-insensitive ZAS members were included in the phylogenetic analysis for comparison. These are RspChrR, BsuYlaD, BsuRsiW and ScoRsuA. Only the N-terminal ASD domain was included in multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction. The phylogenetic tree demonstrated that the majority of the retrieved homologs cluster closely with ScoRsrA (Group I), next to the second cluster (Group II), which harbors CglRshA from C. glutamicum <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>. Known insensitive ZAS genes were clustered within Groups III and IV. For experimental analysis, we selected nine candidates from dispersed branches of group I and group II clusters <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>, open circles); Rv3221A (MtuRshA), MSMEG_1915 (M. smegmatis), BlinB_ 010200019545 (Brevibacterium linens), nfa45830 (Nocardia farcinica), RHA1_ro06382 (Rhodococcus jostii), FRAAL6009 (Frankia alni), Tfu_0549 (Thermobifida fusca), DIP0710 (C. diphtheria) and AAur_2640 (Arthrobacter aurescens). A candidate from a branch in Group IV, NCgl0852 (C. glutamicum), was also selected for experimental analysis. The corresponding genes were synthesized through PCR amplification of chromosomal DNA as described in 'Materials and Methods' section. We <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Phylogenetic relatedness of ScoRsrA homologs. A neighbor-joining tree of RsrA homologs were constructed by using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b33a87b577-software-simple-5">MEGA4</rs> with default parameters. In addition to 104 homologs retrieved by BlastP, ZAS factors which have been reported to be insensitive to oxidation (marked with diamonds) were included in the tree. Only the ASD that corresponds to ScoRsrA in each entry was compared. Sequence information for all entries is provided in the Supplementary Table S3. Reported redox-senstive RsrA homologs were marked with close circles. MtuRshA_M_tuberculosis_and_M_bovis represents 25 identical sequences from M. tuberculosis or M. bovis strains. The 10 homologs whose redox-sensitivity was experimentally examined in this study were marked with open circles. Homologs from non-actinobacteria were marked with open triangles. cloned these genes in pSET152H to replace the rsrA gene in the sigR-rsrA operon of S. coelicolor as diagramed in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>A. The resulting hybrid operons were introduced into the chromosome of DsigRrsrA strain through the att site. If the product of the cloned gene behaves similarly to ScoRsrA, it is expected to bind SigR in S. coelicolor and keep it inactive under non-stressed condition, but will release SigR to transcribe its target genes under oxidative stress conditions. We analyzed transcripts from SigRdependent sigRp2 and trxBp1 promoters by S1 mapping in various recombinant S. coelicolor strains before and after treatment with 0.5-mM diamide for varying lengths of time. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>B shows representative S1 results, which demonstrate that several homologs behave similarly as ScoRsrA and thus deserve to be called its orthologs.SigR activation as ScoRsrA did. MtuRshA (Rv3221A) was less efficient in sequestering ScoSigR under nonstressed condition, resulting in higher basal-level expression. However, it responded to diamide induction as expected <ref type="bibr">(12)</ref>. On the other hand, those from Corynebacterium spp. (NCgl0852 and DIP0710) appeared inactive in binding SigR, since the basal-level expression of both sigRp2 and trxBp1 transcripts were constitutively high regardless of diamide treatment. Therefore, it is not possible to assess their redox sensitivity by our analyses. Considering a difference in GC content between Corynebacterium (54%) and S. coelicolor (72%) genomes, there also exist a possibility that not enough corynebacterial ZAS proteins are expressed due to codon bias and other post-transcriptional defects. We quantified S1 results from more than three independent experiments for each recombinant strain, and presented diamide sensitivity of each homolog as fold-induction values compared with the unstressed level (Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref>). This analysis, therefore, allowed us to identify seven new redox-sensitive ZAS factors, which appear to be functional orthologs of ScoRsrA in binding sigma factor SigR and responding to thiol oxidative stress.</p>
        <p>Multiple sequence alignment of ASDs from nine redoxsensitive and five insensitive ZAS factors reveal residues that are conserved across all ZAS and those that are restricted to redox-sensitive ZAS from actinomycetes <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). In order to delineate broadly functional residues from subfamily-specific residues in a more systematic way, we compared differentially conserved sequence patterns by constructing sequence logos through <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b33a87b577-software-simple-6">TEXshade</rs> package <ref type="bibr">(34,35)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> demonstrated conserved sequence logo of all 14 ZAS members, and a differentially conserved logo of experimentally validated sensitive ZAS (nos 1-9) and insensitive ZAS (nos <ref type="bibr">10-14)</ref>. Residues around the HCC motif (from K33 to E46 in ScoRsrA) show some differentially conserved pattern in sensitive versus insensitive ZAS proteins. There are also highly conserved residues among sensitive ZAS such as L22, D23, E25, Y48, E51, K55, C62, P68, L71 and R72. However, from sequence gazing, it is not possible to distinguish residues that are conserved across actinomycetes from those that may contribute to redox sensitivity. We therefore proceeded to examine the contribution of the region that surrounds the conserved ZAS motif to determining redox sensitivity.</p>
        <p>We created recombinant proteins by exchanging residues from K33 to K47 in ScoRsrA with the corresponding residues (V26 to H40) in RsiW from B. subtilis <ref type="figure">(Figure 4A)</ref>. The truncated version of RsiW (T-RsiW) that contains only the N-terminal 87 amino acid of ASD without trans-membrane and extracellular domains was modified to make the recombinant. The secondary structure of the swapped product (ST-RsiW) was predicted unchanged by <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b33a87b577-software-simple-7">Jnet</rs> program <ref type="bibr">(39)</ref>. The recombinant B. subtilis strains that harbor either T-rsiW or ST-rsiW genes in place of the wild-type rsiW were examined to determine whether diamide can induce SigW-specific gene expression. Production of ST-RsiW or T-RsiW was controlled by IPTG <ref type="bibr">(14)</ref>, and the amount of auto-regulated sigW transcripts following diamide treatment was examined by S1 mapping. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>B demonstrates that when T-RsiW is induced, sigW expression is drastically reduced, confirming the ability of T-RsiW to bind and sequester SigW. Treatment with diamide did not activate SigW at all, and the sigW gene <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Multiple sequence alignment and sequence logo of ScoRsrA homologs. Mulitple sequence alignment was carried out by using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b33a87b577-software-simple-8">MEGA4</rs>, followed by manual curation. Sequence logos were produced by using <rs cert="0.9" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="b33a87b577-software-simple-9">TEXshade</rs>. The secondary structure prediction is based on the structural information of RspChrR (PDB;2Z2S). For alignment, we trimmed both N-terminal and C-terminal residues that extend beyond the ScoRsrA sequence. The nucleotide sequencing identified some sequence differences from the public database, and we used modified sequences for BlinB_010200019545, AAur_2640 and FRAAL6009 (+; Supplementary Table S3). Asterisk indicates entries that contain C-terminal domains in addition to ASD. expression was even lowered compared with the unstressed level. Production of ST-RsiW reduced the sigW gene expression by $60%, indicating some partial binding of SigW by ST-RsiW. When diamide was treated, the expression level increased up to about 4-fold after 40 min of treatment, and then decreased to the basal level at 80 min. This result demonstrates that the HCC region of ScoRsrA conferred redox sensitivity to the insensitive RsiW.</p>
        <p>In order to find more ZAS factors that are sensitive to thiol oxidation, close homologs of ScoRsrA in NCBI nr database (as of 8 November 2008) were searched by <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="b33a87b577-software-simple-10">BlastP</rs>. Only the ASD corresponding to 103 amino acids of ScoRsrA was compared. Using a cutoff E-value of 0.3, 114 candidates were retrieved (See Supplementary Table S3 for sequence information). Most of them are from actinobacteria, except four; Rmet_0596 (Ralstonia metallidurans CH34, Betaproteobacteria), CHU_0600 (Cytophaga hutchinsonii ATCC 33406, Bacteroidetes), Ccel_0804 (Clostridium cellulolyticum H10, Firmicutes) and Ctha_1264 (Chloroherpeton thalassium ATCC 35110, Chlorobi). The list included reported ZAS factors such as RshA from M. tuberculosis (12,17,27) and a predicted ZAS RshA from C. glutamicum <ref type="bibr">(25)</ref>. Except for NCgl0852 from C. glutamicum, all ZAS genes are adjacent to ECF sigma factor genes. In M. tuberculosis and M. bovis strains, genes for ZAS (RshA) and sigma factor (SigH) are separated by a hypothetical ORF.</p>

Potential heterogeneity of ORs for a given SNP between the two populations was tested both by Breslow -Day test and by partitioning the x 2 statistic between the two populations. Test of independent contribution of a SNP controlling for the effect of other SNPs in the same gene was done by logistic regression as well as haplotype analyses. Association with subphenotype was analyzed by comparing cases with a certain subphenotype with controls, cases without the subphenotype with controls, heterogeneity test of two ORs so derived and direct comparison of the cases with and without the subphenotypes.</p>

        <p>We performed a smoothing step to control for the local dependency of the signal in linear genomic space, since we are interested in identifying 3D hotspots of physically proximal yet genomically distal ChIP-seq peaks in subsequent analyses. Specifically, we smoothed each normalized ChIP-seq signal along each chromosome arm using <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-simple-19">SuperSmoother</rs> <ref type="bibr">(33)</ref>, which is implemented as <rs corresp="#f76f57dbbc-software-4" resp="#curator" subtype="component" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-simple-20">supsmu()</rs> in <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-4">R</rs> (version <rs corresp="#f76f57dbbc-software-4" resp="#annotator2" type="version">3.0.2</rs>) package '<rs cert="0.7" corresp="#f76f57dbbc-software-4" resp="#annotator2" subtype="component" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-simple-23">stats</rs>', with the span determined by cross-validation. We then took the residuals of each smoothed normalized signal -this constitutes the final 'ChIP-seq peak height' that we proceeded to superpose onto the 3D genome reconstruction.</p>
        <p>The 3D genome reconstruction consists of a series of beads spaced along each chromosome; each bead has a genomic position and (X,Y,Z) coordinates. For each ChIP-seq input, we binned its peak height data (i.e. the residuals of the smoothed log 2 -normalized signal) such that each bin was centered on a bead. We then assigned to each bead the most extreme ChIP-seq peak height (positive or negative) from the bin centered on that bead. The result is a 3D chromatin configuration reconstruction overlaid with functional genomic data: each bead now has a genomic position, physical coordinates (X,Y,Z) and a ChIP-seq peak height value. We visualized this superposed 3D reconstruction in <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-23">MacPy- MOL</rs> <rs corresp="#f76f57dbbc-software-23" resp="#annotator2" type="version">1.3</rs> <ref type="bibr">(34)</ref> by first converting the data to the Protein Data Bank (PDB) file format <ref type="bibr">(35)</ref> with the ChIP-seq peak height value rescaled as the temperature factor (B-factor) in the PDB file.</p>
        <p>We applied <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-simple-26">PRIM</rs> using the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-201">R</rs> package '<rs cert="0.7" corresp="#f76f57dbbc-software-201" resp="#curator" subtype="component" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-simple-28">prim</rs>' <ref type="bibr">(36)</ref> to discover 3D hotspots in ChIP-seq peak height superposed on the 3D reconstruction. We used the default parameter settings peel alpha = 0.5 and paste alpha = 0.01 (we explored alternative settings subsequently) and used min beads = 25, the smallest parameter setting out of those tested (10, 25, 50 and 100) for which inter-chromosomal hotspots could be detected. After applying PRIM, each bead in the superposed 3D reconstruction now has a genomic position, physical (X,Y,Z) coordinates, a ChIP-seq peak height value and a numerical PRIM box label (the largest numerical label is a placeholder for the beads that were not boxed). We estimated the significance of all of the PRIM boxes (except for the placeholder) by permutations as follows. We preserved the mapping of beads to PRIM boxes, and then permuted the ChIP-seq peak height along each chromosome. Then, we computed the mean ChIP-seq peak height for each PRIM box from the permuted data. We repeated this for a total of 10 5 permutations. The P-value of each box was estimated by comparing its mean ChIP-seq peak height from the observed data to its mean ChIP-seq peak height values from the permuted data. We ranked these potential 3D hotspots by P-value and Holm-adjusted the P-values to account for multiple testing. To gauge the effect size of the mean ChIP-seq peak height of each hotspot, we also computed Z-scores: the difference between the observed mean outcome and the mean of the mean outcomes across all permutations, divided by the standard deviation of the mean outcomes across all permutations.</p>
        <p>We applied k-NN regression to the ChIP-seq peak height superposed on the 3D reconstruction using the <rs cert="0.7" resp="#curator" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-202">R</rs> package '<rs cert="0.7" corresp="#f76f57dbbc-software-202" resp="#annotator2" subtype="component" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-simple-30">FNN</rs>' <ref type="bibr">(37)</ref>, where k is the specified number of physically proximal beads to be analyzed together as a grouping. First, we selected 'seed' beads evenly spaced along each chromosome by a bead interval of 0.5*k. Next, for each seed bead, we found its k nearest beads in Euclidean distance via the function knn.index() to create a bead grouping. Finally, we found the mean ChIP-seq peak height of each bead grouping via the function knn.reg() and ranked the list of bead groupings by mean ChIP-seq peak height.</p>
        <p>We normalized the S. cerevisiae contact data from <ref type="formula">(7)</ref> using <rs cert="0.7" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="f76f57dbbc-software-simple-31">HiCNorm</rs> (25) (see 'Methods') and then generated a new 3D genome reconstruction from the normalized contact data via the constrained optimization approach from (7) as per <ref type="formula">(17)</ref> (the original study <ref type="formula">(7)</ref> preceded the formalization of pipelines for normalizing Hi-C contact data <ref type="bibr">(25,38- 40)</ref>).</p>

        <p>Carbonylated proteins were derivatized with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) to form 2-4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (DNP) proteins adducts <ref type="bibr">[23]</ref>. For total carbonyl quantification, equal quantities of proteins were loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE 12% (v/v). Chemicals for SDS-PAGE were purchased from BioRad. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. For the detection of carbonylated proteins, gels were electrotransferred onto Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare) and incubated with anti-DNP antibodies (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich). Carbonylated proteins were revealed by a fluorescent anti-rabbit IgG 800CW (1:15,000) polyclonal antibody (LI-COR).

To take into account the total amount of loaded protein in each IPG strip, we defined a %vol per carbonylated spot (N%vol) by normalizing the %vol of each anti-DNP incubated membrane with its corresponding %vol on the Fast Green-stationed membrane. The relative modification index ratio (RMI ratio) was obtained by dividing the N%vol of the old group of samples by the N%vol of the young one.</p>

The blots were scanned and the ratios of optical band intensities of aggrecan normalized to HSP 90 were calculated using <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" type="software" xml:id="a690616f6c-software-simple-3">TINA</rs> software. Experiments were done in duplicates.</p>
        <p>Aggrecan is upregulated after FeCl 3 induced injury. In addition, we investigated the aggrecan expression in the injured CNS by western blotting. For this analysis, the hemisphere of iron-induced lesion as well as the correspondent contralateral hemisphere were dissected and prepared for subsequent processing. Protein extracts were run in a 6% gel. Western blot analysis with the anti-aggrecan antibody AB1031 revealed a single band at B450 kDa in injured and uninjured hemispheres (Figure <ref type="figure">7a</ref>). A comparative quantification with <rs cert="1.0" resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a690616f6c-software-100">TINA</rs> software (<rs corresp="#a690616f6c-software-100" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Raytest</rs>, Straubenhardt, Germany) revealed higher contents of aggrecan in iron-injected hemispheres for all tested mouse lines, with significant differences in mice lacking brevican or HAPLN1 (Figure <ref type="figure">7b</ref>).</p>

        <p>Demographic data (age and sex), the presence of LSTV in the radiographic images and its type was recorded in all the 3 groups. Among the patients in group B who also had an MRI, disc degeneration was assessed by Pfirrmann's grading system <ref type="figure">Fig. 4)</ref> <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>. Similar grading of disc degeneration was done in group C at the non herniated levels, i.e., if M1 was the herniated level, Pfirrmann's grading was assigned to the discs at the M2 and M3levels. Based on this system, degeneration was graded as 'normal' (Pfirrmann's grade I), 'mild' (Pfirrmann's grade II) and 'advanced' (grades III-V). This was based on Lam et al. <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>'s findings of a positive provocative discography in 0%, 9%, and 71% of patients with Pfirrmann's grades I, II, III respectively and 100% in patients with Pfirrmann's grade IV and V. Lam et al. <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> stated that Pfirrmann's grading correlated strongly with the clinical symptoms. Radiological images of 1,000 consecutive patients meeting the inclusion criteria were selected for each group retrospectively from the hospital's OPD and operation records. The sample size of 3,000 was calculated from a similar study by Kong et al. <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>, in which they found no significant difference between the LSTV and non-LSTV groups in degenerative spondylolisthesis patients, with a p-value of 0.8 and a sample size of 78, using "the N master software. " In order to maintain consistency and avoid inter-observer variability, all the observations, classifications and grading were done by a single qualified spinal surgeon. The study was conducted in a major tertiary care centre with a daily OPD input of 6,000 patients including all specialities. The chi-square and proportion tests were used to compare 2 sets of variables and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was done using 'The <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator2" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="bd68074248-software-simple-0">R</rs> statistical software' by a qualified statistician. Probability and relative risks were also calculated using the same software.</p>

Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic, defined as the proportion of total variation observed between the trials attributable to differences between trials rather than sampling error (chance), with values &lt;25% considered as low and &gt;75% as high. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> The pooled effect for each grouping of trials was derived from the point estimate for each separate trial weighted by the inverse of the variance (1/SE 2 ). Continuous variable outcomes (PRU, per cent platelet inhibition) between the groups were compared with both a fixed effect model using the inverse variance method and a random effects model using the DerSimonian and Laird method. For cardiovascular outcomes, rates were expressed per patient-years to adjust for the varying duration of follow-up. Results were therefore reported as incident rate ratios (IRR) and 95% CIs with the use of both a fixed effect model using the method of Mantel and Haenszel and a random effects model using the method of DerSimonian and Laird, with the estimate of heterogeneity being taken from the Mantel-Haenszel model. Publication bias was estimated using the weighted regression tests of Begg and Egger. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> For platelet reactivity indices, analyses were stratified based on whether standard-dose (75 mg) or high-dose (150 mg) clopidogrel was used in the DAPT arm. In addition, further sensitivity analyses were performed based on the cohort enrolled: (1) acute coronary syndrome (ACS) versus not; and (2) enrolment of patients with HTPR at baseline versus not. For cardiovascular outcomes, analyses were stratified based on stent typedrug eluting stent (DES) versus Bare metal stent (BMS). A p value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant.</p>

        <p>Single-channel current transitions were identified using the algorithm described previously <ref type="bibr">(Andersen, 1983)</ref>, implemented in <rs corresp="#b9432ca455-software-0" resp="#curator" subtype="implicit" type="software" xml:id="b9432ca455-software-simple-0">software</rs> written in <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator8" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="b9432ca455-software-0">Visual Basic</rs> (<rs corresp="#b9432ca455-software-0" resp="#curator" type="publisher">Microsoft Corp</rs>.).

At least 300 channels were collected in each experiment. Changes in appearance frequency ( f ), the number of channels (opening followed by closing events) per unit of time, were determined only in experiments in which the bilayer remained intact after adding the phospholipid. The results were reported as means &#177; SD; in case there were only two observations, the results were reported as means &#177; range. Relative changes in appearance frequency were determined by normalizing the appearance frequency in the first two recordings right after the 10-min incubation <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.

Two population, two-tailed, independent Student's t tests were used to establish whether two means were significantly different (P &#8804; 0.05). A one-way ANOVA test performed on all compared means indicated significant differences (P &#8804; 0.05).</p>

        <p>A total of 172 students (152 in the four main reporting treatments and 20 in the strategy method treatment) participated in ten experiment sessions in 2013 and 2014 at the University of Michigan. 17 Among them, 58.7% of subjects (101) were female. No subject participated in more than one session, and the sessions lasted about an hour on average, about half of this time being spent on reading of instructions and answering comprehension questions. The experiment was programmed in <rs cert="0.8" resp="#annotator20" type="software" xml:id="a9655cffa3-software-1">z-tree</rs> <ref type="bibr">(Fischbacher 2007)</ref>. All instructions (for the example of the LC treatment, see Supporting Information) were neutrally framed, avoiding terms such as "cooperate," "trust," and so on. Subjects had to answer a number of control questions (see the instructions) to confirm their understanding of the experiment. Communication between subjects was not permitted. Average earnings were $20.84, including a $5 participation fee, with a standard deviation of $4.16. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> summarizes key subject behaviors and beliefs, with panels (A) (at left), (B) (upper right), and (C) lower right displaying cooperation decisions, decisions to report defectors, and decisions to report cooperators, respectively. We begin with our main focus, costly reporting. A glance at panel (B) makes clear that there was much costly reporting, but overwhelmingly reporting of defectors by cooperators, as predicted. Focusing on the left panel of 17. Sessions were conducted by Kamei while he was Assistant Professor at Bowling Green State University. All subjects were recruited from the University of Michigan experimental lab's subject pool using solicitation messages via <rs resp="#curator" type="software" xml:id="a9655cffa3-software-simple-1">ORSEE (Online Recruitment System for Economic Experiments)</rs>. We aimed to recruit 20 participants to each session, but actual numbers varied somewhat due to differing show-up rates, averaging 17.2. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>B, we see that some 45%-65% of cooperators who encountered a defector chose to report when costly, and that reporting occurred considerably more often (almost 90% report) at cost zero (NC treatment) than at positive costs (an overall average of 58.6% report in LC, MC, and HC). The remainder of this panel and the panel below it, in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>C, show that there is also some, but considerably less, costly reporting of cooperators by cooperators and of defectors by defectors, and no costly reporting of cooperators by defectors. Overall, an average of 8.0% of subjects in the cooperator-cooperator, defectorcooperator, and defector-defector situations choose to report.</p>

        <p>The logistic regression analyses were conducted separately for men and women for NAFLD as an outcome. The potential predictors that were used in the analyses were: age, marriage (married vs. unmarried), residency (rural vs. urban), smoking (smoking vs. non-smoking), obesity (obese vs. non-obese), blood pressure (high BP vs. low), triglyceride (high TG vs. low), and high-density lipoprotein (low HDL vs. high). The obesity, high BP, high TG, and low HDL were defined based on a joint interim statement definition of MetS <ref type="bibr">(10)</ref>. The Wald test, significant levels, and odd ratios (OR) were reported. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for the logistic regressions. All statistical analyses were conducted using statistical software (<rs resp="#curator" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="a07cded56d-software-0">SPSS</rs> Inc., version <rs corresp="#a07cded56d-software-0" resp="#annotator3" type="version">21</rs>, Chicago, IL and <rs cert="1.0" resp="#annotator3" subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="a07cded56d-software-1">Stata</rs> software, version <rs corresp="#a07cded56d-software-1" resp="#annotator3" type="version">12</rs>, <rs corresp="#a07cded56d-software-1" resp="#curator" type="publisher">StataCorp</rs>, Texas, US). The significant levels in all analyses were considered to be 0.05. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the basic characteristics of the study population based on residency. While the rural people had a higher WC, SBP, AST, FBS, HDL, and HOMA, the urban people had a higher DBP. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the basic characteristics of the study population based on marriage status. Based on our results, married people had a higher mean age, WC, DBP, GGT, ALT, FBS, and TG, but a lower HDL than unmarried people did. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> shows the results of the univariate and multivariate binary logistic regressions. In these analyses, the NAFLD was considered to be the outcome variable. NAFLD had a direct association with marriage status in men (OR = 2.770 (2.004 -3.831), P value &lt; 0.001) and women (OR = 1.241 (1.033 -1.490), P value = 0.0209), and an inverse association with living in rural areas for men (OR = 0.513 (0.422 -0.622), P value &lt; 0.001) and women (OR = 0.431 (0.345 -0.539), P value &lt; 0.001).</p>

        <p>We have performed a simple experiment to explore: (1) our current knowledge of the universe of sequences, and how this knowledge has evolved in the past years, and (2) the possible extent of failures when taxonomically assigning ORFs to their closest relatives. Using the <rs type="software">Blast in Grids (BiG)</rs> service <ref type="bibr">(Aparicio et al., 2007)</ref>, we have run <rs type="software">BLASTX</rs> searches for several metagenomes against the realease 159 (April 2007) of GenBank non-redundant protein database, extracted the homologues found for each putative ORF [following the procedure described in <ref type="bibr">Tamames and Moya (2008)</ref>] and assigned the ORF to the taxon of its best hit (where different threshold of minimum identity have been used). Next, we have collected the dates of creation of the GenBank entries of these hits. In this way, we can simulate the results that we would have obtained in the past, by restricting the list of homologues to those already present in the database in a particular date, which allowed us to explore how the results change as the database grows. The experiment was repeated for different metagenomes and different taxonomic depths. One of the results is shown in the Figure <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">1A</ref>, for a farm soil metagenome <ref type="bibr">(Tringe et al., 2005)</ref>. Each row corresponds to a single ORF, displaying the colour of the class to which it would have been assigned in different dates. The plot shows clearly that many of the assignments have changed, even in recent times (between 10% and 20% of the assignments at class level have varied in the last 2 years). This can be easily seen in Figure <ref target="#fig_0" type="figure">1B</ref>, which shows the accumulated number of changes with respect to previous dates. Several trends are noticeable: (1) The rate of change does not decrease in recent times, instead it clearly increases for most cases. This trend of change can be noticed even for broad taxonomic ranks such as phylum: for instance, Acidobacteria phylum is now recognized as one of the most abundant taxa in many soils <ref type="bibr">(Barns et al., 1999)</ref>, but until recently no sequences were assigned to it. This indicates that the full diversity of these communities is still not well described in the current databases, and that best hit approach for taxonomic classification is at least risky. (2) Although most changes consist in the assignment of previously unclassified ORFs, the classification for many ORFs has also changed. (3) Abrupt changes occur in response to the availability of complete genomes, especially from close species to those represented in the metagenomes. Again for Acidobacteria, We analyzed 60 000 randomly selected sequences from the full metagenome, using blastx searches and a threshold of 60% minimum identity between query and hit proteins. Each row in the plot corresponds to a single ORF, showing with colours how the assignment has varied in time (colours indicate different taxonomic classes). (B) This plot shows the accumulated number of ORFs that changed their assignment between consecutive months (expressed as the ratio of number of changes/total number of ORFs), for different metagenomes (Blue, whale fall; Red, human gut; Green, farm soil; Black, Sargasso sea). The changes are divided between new assignments (the ORF was previously unassigned, dashed lines) and assignment changes (assignment to a different taxon, solid lines). The figure also emphasizes three dates in which many assignments change, in accordance to the release of particular complete genomes of importance for the description of these microbial communities.</p>

        <p>A 123-base pair (bp) segment of human &#946;-globin gene was used as amplification control to ascertain the quality of the DNA, as described previously <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref>. For detection of MCPyV DNA, LT3 primer which is very specific for amplification of the MCPyV T antigen (TAg) sequence was used <ref type="bibr">(3)</ref>. All primers were synthesized by Metabion International AG (Martinsried, Germany). Merkel Cell Polyomavirus DNA was detected in both tumors of patient (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> A) and 309 bp putative PCR product was cloned into the pTZ57R/T PCR cloning vector (InsTAclone&#8482; PCR cloning Kit, Fermentas, MD, USA), then submitted for sequencing (Bioneer, Daejeon, South Korea). The sequences were aligned with reference sequences of MCPyV (MCC350, MCC339, TKS, MKL-1) using the National Center for Biotechnology Information Blast algorithm. The sequences were deposited in GenBank with the Accession Numbers KF442250 and KF442251. The results of sequence alignment showed that they were 100% identical to those of the MCC339 and MKL-1 isolates.</p>

        <p>In order to assess the effect of policy reforms on each of our well-being concepts, we simulate four hypothetical policy reforms. As described before, we use <rs type="software">EUROMOD</rs> to simulate disposable incomes and Eqs. 2-7 to derive the effects on life satisfaction and equivalent incomes. In all counterfactual scenarios, budget neutrality is achieved by an increase in the top tax rate of the government income tax, which is 25% in Sweden. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> The different scenarios are described in detail in Section 4.1. The following subsections discuss the average gains and losses, the resulting inequality in well-being and the effects on social welfare. All results are based on the estimates of Model 2 in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p>
        <p>In order to calculate household disposable income under different policy reform scenarios, we use EUROMOD, the EU tax-benefit microsimulation model. <rs type="software">EUROMOD</rs> simulates cash benefit entitlements and direct personal tax and social insurance contribution liabilities on the basis of the tax-benefit rules in place in each of the 28 EU Member States. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> The underlying micro-data used for the simulations in <rs type="software">EUROMOD</rs> is EU-SILC, which contains detailed information on different income sources as well as household and individual characteristics.</p>

        <p>The TK data were used to estimate plasma C max , C min , and daily systemic dose (AUC 24 h ) of 2,4-D. The AUC 24 h was calculated from the 3 plasma samples extrapolated to 24 h assuming steady-state plasma concentrations and similar daily fluctuations of the systemic dose due to the feeding pattern of the rats <ref type="bibr">(McCoy et al., 2012; Saghir et al., 2006, 2012)</ref>. Dose-dependent TK behavior was determined graphically and by comparing ratios of plasma 2,4-D AUC 24 h at any selected dose to the lowest tested dose (100 ppm) and assuming linear TK behavior at the 100-ppm dose. The comparison was made both for the nominal (ie, ppm in diet) and the actual ingested (mg/kg/day) doses. <rs corresp="#PMC3858196-software-100" type="publisher">Microsoft</rs> <rs type="software" xml:id="PMC3858196-software-100">Excel</rs> was used to calculate TK parameters.</p>

        <p>TAP-tagged samples were eluted from IgG Sepharose with TEV cleavage and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Two experimental and two control samples (mock purification from a Tetrahymena cell line not expressing TAP-Pot1a) were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and visualized by colloidal Coomassie. The entire lane was excised, divided into 16 pieces, and prepared for MS analysis by in-gel reduction, alkylation, and trypsin digestion.

        <p>The test results suggest that being in a love marriage or being in a marriage by introduction are good instruments in the sense that they are both strong and valid 4 Estimations using an ordered logit model that takes into account the ordinal nature of the dependent variable confirmed those results, but are not reported in this article so as not to detract from its focus. They are available from the author upon request.for marital satisfaction, but only as long as we do not take into account possible heteroskedasticity. However, a formal test for the presence of heteroskedasticity rejects the null hypothesis of homoskedastic disturbances. <ref type="bibr">Breusch and Pagan (1979)</ref> theoretically developed a test and we carried out this test using the <rs type="software">ivhettest</rs> command written by <ref type="bibr">Schaffer (2002)</ref> in Stata.</p>

        <p>In practice, the within estimator is obtained by carrying out first a within transformation then calculating the least squares estimator on these centred variables. However, this has to be done carefully because, as transformed variables are being used, the standard estimator of the variance obtained with the ordinary least squares procedure does not correspond directly to the unbiased estimator of the variance of the within model. It underestimates it. A multiplying factor (CT -K) / (CT -C -K) needs to be taken into account, where C is the number of cohorts, T the number of observation dates and K the number of explanatory variables. In <rs subtype="environment" type="software">SAS</rs>, the <rs type="software">Bwithin macro</rs> written by <ref type="bibr">Duguet (1999)</ref> takes this problem into account (for other <rs subtype="environment" type="software">Stata</rs> and <rs subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="c0c57cc671-software-100">R</rs> <rs corresp="#c0c57cc671-software-100" subtype="implicit" type="software">procedures</rs>, see <ref type="bibr">Guillerm, 2015)</ref>.</p>
        <p>Issues of implementation of statistical software are not addressed in the articles. Examples of <rs subtype="environment" type="software">SAS</rs>, <rs subtype="environment" type="software">R</rs> and <rs subtype="environment" type="software">Stata</rs> programmes are provided in <ref type="bibr">Guillerm (2015)</ref>, on which the article is based.</p>
        <p>We then checked whether our results were dependant on our identification strategy. In particular, <ref type="bibr">Chauvel and Schroeder (2014)</ref>, who demonstrate that the baby boom generations had more disposable income than other generations and whose results differ from our own, use a different strategy based on <ref type="bibr">Chauvel (2013)</ref>. This is called the Age-Period-Cohort-Detrended (APCD) method and focuses on the fluctuations in the age, cohort and period effects around their respective linear trend. It cannot be used to compare cohorts with one another, only in relation to an unknown coefficient. We present this method in the C4 online supplement and we used the <rs corresp="#c0c57cc671-software-101" subtype="component" type="software">APCD module</rs> (available on <rs subtype="environment" type="software" xml:id="c0c57cc671-software-101">Stata</rs>) with our data in an attempt to reproduce their results.</p>

          <title>tions here exactly the same as in England. Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that Judge Gould's decision will give a marked impetus to the growing sentiment among American trade-unionists in favor of independent political action. It hardly seems probable that the trade-unionists will allow themselves to be beaten back from position to position without using every weapon in their arsenal. The one powerful weapon, which, as yet, they have hardly begun to utilize, is the ballot. Employers' associations may destroy this or that particular manifestation of trade-unionism, but they cannot destroy its spirit. The trade-union spirit is an inevitable outcome of the activities and environment of the wage-worker under present industrial conditions, and cannot be destroyed so long as those conditions remain unchanged. If one weapon of the trade-unionists is destroyed, he is practically certain to find or develop another-perhaps more effective-to take its place</title>

          <title>BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTICES 855 autocracy upon the independence and the comparatively democratic institutions and rights of the German people. The Social Democrats of the rest of the world saw above all the advance of the German troops into neutral Belgium, into republican France" (p. 263). At the present time there appears to be a growing lack of military enthusiasm among the Socialists, amounting in some quarters, especially in Germany, to direct opposition to the continuance of the war. Close examination, however, leads to the suspicion that the desire for peace appears in direct ratio to success in arms. In other words, the Socialists are one with the rest of humanity in desiring peace under favorable conditions. While Mr. Walling's work represents wide reading and judicious selection of material, the result is nevertheless somewhat unsatisfactory. This, however, is the natural consequence of present conditions in Europe. In this time of international struggle it is not surprising to find the opinions of the leading Socialists differing so widely in regard to both aims and methods that even the friendly critic can draw few definite conclusions from the mass of conflicting evidence.

          <title>STATE AID TO RAILROADS IN MISSOURI. I. REASONS FOR AIDING THE ROADS. IN the early history of the State of Missouri the people did not generally desire to have the state enter in its corporate capacity into the construction of public works. It was not long, however, before Missouri began to show much sympathy with the movement common to many of the states in the decades immediately preceding I85o. Pennsylvania, New York, and other of the older states engaged first in the construction of canals. But when the importance of the railroad had been recognized by the commercial world, these states began the construction of railroads, in addition to canals; and many of these enterprises had resulted disastrously long before Missouri began her experiment. The advocates of the experiment in Missouri urged both positive and negative reasons for aiding private corporations in the construction of railroads. The state, it was argued, should assist in the construction of roads because: (I) they would develop the territory of the state, (2) they would, in the near future, become parts of transcontinental lines, and (3) the general government would thus be led to make grants of public lands to the state to be used in assisting railroad construction. The first of these reasons was common to all of the states which had made, or were making, similar experiments. The idea of directing transcontinental traffic of the future through a state was, naturally, most insisted upon in those states which were more nearly central in their location. In Missouri this aim was particularly strong, and exerted a great influence in the earlier days of the state's experiment, because roads were being projected westward both north and south of the state. Each of the central states was naturally desirous of securing for itself as much as possible of the prospective advantage. Moreover, the gold discoveries at this time (i850) also rendered this idea prominent</title>

          <title>BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTICES 645 pages to find, if the reader were sure that it did not refer to the page-reference to some public document. Note "250" after some turning of pages is finally found to inform the reader that "the italics are the writers's." Such variations in the value of the references make the readers uncertain how many of them to consult. When one reads, on p. 68, "Prices for most staple articles at the company stores are not now higher than credit prices elsewhere,262" experience may have led one to assume that "262" refers to a page-reference for the authority. In fact, over on p. 229, the note says : "There is some difference of opinion on this point. The statement in the text is supported by the testimony of state mine inspectors and officials of the United Mine Workers." Certainly some of the more valuable of these references might have been placed where the reader could readily see them. The work is a valuable addition to existing knowledge of the growth of labor legislation, and its close relation to industrial development. It is to be hoped that the same work will be done for other states, both those more fully developed industrially and those less fully developed. "Social betterment" will profit by comparative studies and comparative studies are only possible with more such works as this one. ^ ^ ^</title>
